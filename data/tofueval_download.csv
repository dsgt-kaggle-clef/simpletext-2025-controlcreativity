CNN-105920_6_Bush vs. Clinton Comparisons_Model-Extra,"DOBBS: Coming up at the top of the hour here on CNN, ""THE SITUATION ROOM"" with Wolf Blitzer. Here's Wolf -- Wolf.
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much, Lou. Poker, hookers and the CIA? Police search the home of the man who was the third in charge over at the Central Intelligence Agency. It's a very complicated story, but we are going to sort it out for you tonight. Also, President Bush's immigration plan, he's planning, as you know, a prime time address on Monday night. We'll take a closer look at what he's expected to say. And Saddam Hussein's new book. That's right. On the eve of the U.S.-led invasion he was supposedly finishing his novel. We have the story. And Bush versus Clinton, how does the current president stack up against the previous one? We hit the streets to find out. We've got some new poll numbers on that. Lots more coming up, Lou, at the top of the hour.
DOBBS: Looking forward to it. Thank you, Wolf. An update tonight on the story we reported here last night. A judge in California issuing a temporary injunction tonight against California's new high school exit exam. Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate. Turning now to the war in Iraq, four of our Marines have been killed in an accident in Al Anbar Province west of Baghdad. The Marines were crewmen in a M-1 Abrams tank. The tank rolled off a bridge and fell into a canal. Two thousand four hundred and thirty four of our troops have now died in Iraq since the war began three years ago. ""Heroes"" now, our weekly tribute to the brave men and women who serve this nation around the world. Tonight we go to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and meet Marines who bravely gave for their country on the battlefield and now give to one another after the battle. Barbara Starr has the story.
BARBARA STARR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is morning formation for wounded Marines at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. They sit because some cannot stand. Glenn Minney struggles with a Mother's Day card. A mortar damaged his eyes, but this medic is still the doc.
PETTY OFF. GLENN MINNEY, U.S. NAVY CORPSMAN: That's my job. I'm going continue to do it as long as I can, blind or not.
STARR: In this remarkable place, Marines help each other just as on the battlefield.
GUNNERY SGT. KEN BARNES, U.S. MARINE CORPS: I have a leg injury and I can't get my room vacuumed. One of the guys will be hey, I got no problem, I've got you. You're still required with a leg injury to keep your clothes picked up and all your trash picked up.
STARR: An IED left Gunnery Sergeant Ken Barnes with nerve damage. He knows Marines don't want to need help.
BARNES: That's one of the things that's really nice about this place is you can say, hey, can you give me a hand? And they are immediately on. There are four or five guys that will be standing there waiting to help, but you've got to ask for it.
STARR: Sergeant Karl Klepper's ankle was crushed by a roadside blast.
SGT. KARL KLEPPER, U.S. MARINE CORPS: We're all broken up. We're all beaten up here, but we're not broken, our spirits aren't broken.

K. STARR: As part of their rehab, Klepper and others help at the base school. (on-camera): The Marines here today and these children have an unshakable bond, perhaps only they can understand. Many of these young students now have parents serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
BRANDON, 1ST GRADER: The Marines help us think about what we can write about and what we can help, so we can do good at math and writing.
STARR (voice-over): Lieutenant Colonel Tim Maxwell has a brain injury from a mortar attack. He started the barracks so Marines could recover together.
LT. COL. TIM MAXWELL, U.S. MARINE CORPS: They come here, stay for just a couple of days and see other Marines are wounded and how far they are in life. Instead of going home with their mom and dad and wondering, I wonder what it means to get shot in the leg. I don't know what that means in three months. Here, he'll see.
STARR (on-camera): The Marines see this extraordinary unit will keep going as long as any wounded warrior needs a place to recover. Barbara Starr, CNN, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much, Lou. Poker, hookers and the CIA? Police search the home of the man who was the third in charge over at the Central Intelligence Agency. It's a very complicated story, but we are going to sort it out for you tonight. Also, President Bush's immigration plan, he's planning, as you know, a prime time address on Monday night. We'll take a closer look at what he's expected to say. And Saddam Hussein's new book. That's right. On the eve of the U.S.-led invasion he was supposedly finishing his novel. We have the story. And Bush versus Clinton, how does the current president stack up against the previous one? We hit the streets to find out. We've got some new poll numbers on that. Lots more coming up, Lou, at the top of the hour.
DOBBS: Looking forward to it. Thank you, Wolf. An update tonight on the story we reported here last night. A judge in California issuing a temporary injunction tonight against California's new high school exit exam. Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate. Turning now to the war in Iraq, four of our Marines have been killed in an accident in Al Anbar Province west of Baghdad. The Marines were crewmen in a M-1 Abrams tank. The tank rolled off a bridge and fell into a canal. Two thousand four hundred and thirty four of our troops have now died in Iraq since the war began three years ago. ""Heroes"" now, our weekly tribute to the brave men and women who serve this nation around the world. Tonight we go to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and meet Marines who bravely gave for their country on the battlefield and now give to one another after the battle. Barbara Starr has the story.

It's a very complicated story, but we are going to sort it out for you tonight. Also, President Bush's immigration plan, he's planning, as you know, a prime time address on Monday night. We'll take a closer look at what he's expected to say. And Saddam Hussein's new book. That's right. On the eve of the U.S.-led invasion he was supposedly finishing his novel. We have the story. And Bush versus Clinton, how does the current president stack up against the previous one? We hit the streets to find out. We've got some new poll numbers on that. Lots more coming up, Lou, at the top of the hour.
DOBBS: Looking forward to it. Thank you, Wolf. An update tonight on the story we reported here last night. A judge in California issuing a temporary injunction tonight against California's new high school exit exam. Thousands of students failed the test even though they were tested only on eighth grade math comprehension, ninth and 10th grade level English. California sued by students, 10 of them, who failed the exam. Today's ruling could potentially allow thousands of students who didn't pass that test to graduate. Turning now to the war in Iraq, four of our Marines have been killed in an accident in Al Anbar Province west of Baghdad. The Marines were crewmen in a M-1 Abrams tank. The tank rolled off a bridge and fell into a canal. Two thousand four hundred and thirty four of our troops have now died in Iraq since the war began three years ago. ""Heroes"" now, our weekly tribute to the brave men and women who serve this nation around the world. Tonight we go to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and meet Marines who bravely gave for their country on the battlefield and now give to one another after the battle. Barbara Starr has the story.
BARBARA STARR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is morning formation for wounded Marines at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. They sit because some cannot stand. Glenn Minney struggles with a Mother's Day card. A mortar damaged his eyes, but this medic is still the doc.
PETTY OFF. GLENN MINNEY, U.S. NAVY CORPSMAN: That's my job. I'm going continue to do it as long as I can, blind or not.
STARR: In this remarkable place, Marines help each other just as on the battlefield.
GUNNERY SGT. KEN BARNES, U.S. MARINE CORPS: I have a leg injury and I can't get my room vacuumed. One of the guys will be hey, I got no problem, I've got you. You're still required with a leg injury to keep your clothes picked up and all your trash picked up.
STARR: An IED left Gunnery Sergeant Ken Barnes with nerve damage. He knows Marines don't want to need help.
BARNES: That's one of the things that's really nice about this place is you can say, hey, can you give me a hand? And they are immediately on. There are four or five guys that will be standing there waiting to help, but you've got to ask for it.
STARR: Sergeant Karl Klepper's ankle was crushed by a roadside blast.
SGT. KARL KLEPPER, U.S. MARINE CORPS: We're all broken up. We're all beaten up here, but we're not broken, our spirits aren't broken.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He helps me at math. We call him Sergeant
K. STARR: As part of their rehab, Klepper and others help at the base school. (on-camera): The Marines here today and these children have an unshakable bond, perhaps only they can understand. Many of these young students now have parents serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
BRANDON, 1ST GRADER: The Marines help us think about what we can write about and what we can help, so we can do good at math and writing.
STARR (voice-over): Lieutenant Colonel Tim Maxwell has a brain injury from a mortar attack. He started the barracks so Marines could recover together.
LT. COL. TIM MAXWELL, U.S. MARINE CORPS: They come here, stay for just a couple of days and see other Marines are wounded and how far they are in life. Instead of going home with their mom and dad and wondering, I wonder what it means to get shot in the leg. I don't know what that means in three months. Here, he'll see.
STARR (on-camera): The Marines see this extraordinary unit will keep going as long as any wounded warrior needs a place to recover. Barbara Starr, CNN, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

CNN-134470_18_CEO Earnings_Model-Extra,"ROBERTS: Welcome back to the ""Most News in the Morning."" As the economy crumbles, it is taking some people along with it. Here's a look at some members of the financial meltdown hall of shame. One of the first banks to tumble was Lehman Brothers, and along with it -- Lehman Brothers, rather, along with it CEO Dick Fuld. Fuld testified on the Hill trying to explain the bank's demise and his $480 million earnings over the past eight years. Unlike Lehman, AIG got a government bailout. AIG execs spent more than $300,000 for a weekend retreat less than one week after the government gave the company $85 billion. And the big three with the CEOs of Ford, GM and Chrysler came to Washington hat in hand asking for a bailout. They did it in style. Each flew in on his own jet and took a beating for it on Capitol Hill, so much so that the next time they arrived, a couple of them were in hybrids, another one in a very high-mileage cars. So they got the message.
CHETRY: Well, they're cutting checks with your money, bonuses in the billions, millions for stuff they don't need. When is the pushback going to happen? Well, maybe it's already started. Carol Costello joins us live from Washington. Hi, Carol.
CAROL COSTELLO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kiran. I'm looking at the glass half full this morning. That wall of shame was a good thing because, you know, it's power to the people time. And the battle that pitted Main Street versus Wall Street, Main Street now has the upper hand. Really? Shame works.
COSTELLO (voice-over): Forget about Congress re-regulating Wall Street. Turns out a little public flogging is pretty darn effective. Shame works. From public demonstrations --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's disgusting.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all toxic.
COSTELLO: To scathing public indictments.
CAMPBELL BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: Who is in charge of this process? Who is watching the banks? Who is demanding accountability?
COSTELLO: Right now, it's you, Main Street. When word got out ex- Merrill Lynch boss John Thain spent $1.2 million to renovate his office, public outrage was so extreme, even the man who thought it was OK to pay $35,000 for a toilet finally got it.
JOHN THAIN, FMR. CEO, MERRILL LYNCH: It is clear to me, in today's world, that it was a mistake. I apologize for spending that money on those -- on those things. And I will make it right. I will reimburse the company for all of those costs.
COSTELLO: And he didn't even have to be publicly berated by Congress as so many others have, like ex-Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo whose company sunk in the subprime mess and cost taxpayers millions in bailout money.
ANGELO MOZILO, CEO COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL: I waive any and all severance, in addition canceled the consulting agreement included in my contract.
COSTELLO: Public advocacy groups feel positively vindicated.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Totally. I mean, well, but we have before. This is not the first time. But we do feel vindicated.
COSTELLO: Keep in mind these failed CEOs don't legally have to give up their cushy perks even if their companies benefit from the $700 billion bailout. But some experts say shame is proving to be a most effective weapon.
BRAD GOOGINS, BOSTON COLLEGE CTR. FOR CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP: Change really happens from the inside out, in any institution, whether it's the churches or corporations or whatever. And it really -- you really need to have an outside agitation to open this up.
COSTELLO: Citibank certainly felt that. When word leaked out it was going to spend $42 million for a brand, spanking new corporate jet, people complained so loudly, Citibank got a call from the Obama administration. What did Citibank do? Well, no more new jet.
COSTELLO: That's for sure. Now, it's not to say experts don't think accountability shouldn't be part of the bailout. It absolutely should, or that Wall Street doesn't need a regulation makeover. It just means the tone has already changed. And the fact Main Street won't put up with it anymore gives the president and Congress tremendous power over Wall Street -- Kiran.
CHETRY: All right. Some would say finally, right?
COSTELLO: I know. Yes! Power to the people.
CHETRY: Carol, thanks.
ROBERTS: It was trampled by roughly four million feet and covered in 130 tons of trash on inauguration day, but the National Mall will have to wait for a facelift.

JOHN THAIN, FMR. CEO, MERRILL LYNCH: It is clear to me, in today's world, that it was a mistake. I apologize for spending that money on those -- on those things. And I will make it right. I will reimburse the company for all of those costs.

BRAD GOOGINS, BOSTON COLLEGE CTR. FOR CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP: Change really happens from the inside out, in any institution, whether it's the churches or corporations or whatever. And it really -- you really need to have an outside agitation to open this up.
COSTELLO: Citibank certainly felt that. When word leaked out it was going to spend $42 million for a brand, spanking new corporate jet, people complained so loudly, Citibank got a call from the Obama administration. What did Citibank do? Well, no more new jet.
COSTELLO: That's for sure. Now, it's not to say experts don't think accountability shouldn't be part of the bailout. It absolutely should, or that Wall Street doesn't need a regulation makeover. It just means the tone has already changed. And the fact Main Street won't put up with it anymore gives the president and Congress tremendous power over Wall Street -- Kiran.

CNN-190054_7_Mitt Romney's campaign_Model-Extra,"BLITZER: Starting tomorrow the world will be watching the Olympic Games in London. But they only last a couple of weeks whereas the political Olympics here in the United States pitting Mitt Romney against President Obama will last all summer and then go into the fall. The competition I must say is already in full swing. CNN's John Berman is joining us now to take a closer look at what's going on. John, the events -- are the candidates competing in -- what are these events? Give us a little sense.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are very fit, which is a good thing because when you think about it, our candidates today are like modern day decathlon athletes. They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.
BERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.
RICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.
BERMAN: Pole vault, the latest ""Wall Street Journal""/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.
MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.
ROMNEY: Create jobs.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.
BERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.
JOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.
BERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.
ROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.
BERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.
BERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London.

But they only last a couple of weeks whereas the political Olympics here in the United States pitting Mitt Romney against President Obama will last all summer and then go into the fall. The competition I must say is already in full swing. CNN's John Berman is joining us now to take a closer look at what's going on. John, the events -- are the candidates competing in -- what are these events? Give us a little sense.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are very fit, which is a good thing because when you think about it, our candidates today are like modern day decathlon athletes. They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.
BERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.
RICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.
BERMAN: Pole vault, the latest ""Wall Street Journal""/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.

JOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.
BERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.

That ""EARLY START"" starts at 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. Eastern only on CNN. Get up early even if you don't check it out. I think you'll like it. Mitt Romney himself is making the political Olympic analogy touting his experience organizing the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002. Listen to what he tells CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview in London that will air later tonight.
ROMNEY: The country is in need of a turnaround. The Olympics was a turnaround for businesses I've been associated with that needed a turnaround. That kind of experience of focusing on the most critical issue, building the most effective team possible, creating a common vision, unifying around that vision and then delivering results is something I think the American people would like to see in our economy right now.
BLITZER: Once again that interview with Romney on ""PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT"" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. All right, let's talk a little bit about that and more in our ""Strategy Session"" joining us our CNN political contributor, the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and our CNN contributor, Ana Navarro.

But they only last a couple of weeks whereas the political Olympics here in the United States pitting Mitt Romney against President Obama will last all summer and then go into the fall. The competition I must say is already in full swing. CNN's John Berman is joining us now to take a closer look at what's going on. John, the events -- are the candidates competing in -- what are these events? Give us a little sense.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are very fit, which is a good thing because when you think about it, our candidates today are like modern day decathlon athletes. They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.
BERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.
RICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.
BERMAN: Pole vault, the latest ""Wall Street Journal""/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.
MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.
ROMNEY: Create jobs.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.
BERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.
JOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.
BERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.
ROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.
BERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.
BERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London. And you could say he's already been working on his backstroke after this kerfuffle over the whole U.S./London ready thing -- Wolf.

ROMNEY: The country is in need of a turnaround. The Olympics was a turnaround for businesses I've been associated with that needed a turnaround. That kind of experience of focusing on the most critical issue, building the most effective team possible, creating a common vision, unifying around that vision and then delivering results is something I think the American people would like to see in our economy right now.
BLITZER: Once again that interview with Romney on ""PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT"" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. All right, let's talk a little bit about that and more in our ""Strategy Session"" joining us our CNN political contributor, the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and our CNN contributor, Ana Navarro. She was the national Hispanic co-chair for Jon Huntsman's presidential campaign. Ana, so far not starting off on a great note in Britain especially when you compare --
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just lost Wolf.","President Obama is focusing on connecting with voters by portraying himself as an everyman. He met with the Olympic basketball team to seem relatable. He is also emphasizing his leadership experience by framing his presidency as an economic ""turnaround"". Meanwhile, he is accusing Romney of ""twisting"" his words to make him seem uncaring about small businesses.",0,val,TofuEval
CNN-190054_7_President Obama's strategy_model_A,"BLITZER: Starting tomorrow the world will be watching the Olympic Games in London. But they only last a couple of weeks whereas the political Olympics here in the United States pitting Mitt Romney against President Obama will last all summer and then go into the fall. The competition I must say is already in full swing. CNN's John Berman is joining us now to take a closer look at what's going on. John, the events -- are the candidates competing in -- what are these events? Give us a little sense.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Wolf, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are very fit, which is a good thing because when you think about it, our candidates today are like modern day decathlon athletes. They have to do it all and in a way they're events are harder because only the gold medal counts.
BERMAN (voice-over): Sadly, the 2012 games do not feature golf or jet skiing as official events. So neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney will compete in London. But that doesn't mean they don't have their own games. No. They have the political Olympics. Take the hurdles. Mitt Romney had to leap over his GOP foes just to get here. You think jumping over Cain, Perry and Gingrich was easy? Just ask Rick Santorum. He ended up with the silver.
RICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will suspend our campaign effective today.
BERMAN: Pole vault, the latest ""Wall Street Journal""/NBC poll showed the president vaulting to a six-point lead. Synchronized diving even without the Speedos, both campaigns medal in endless precision repetition.
MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Middle class.
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The middle class.
ROMNEY: Create jobs.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Create jobs.
BERMAN: While we're in the pool, a politician's least favorite event, the backstroke. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu just visited the podium after saying the president need to learn how to be an American. Check out his backstroke.
JOHN SUNUNU, FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR: Frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words and I apologize for using those words.
BERMAN: Weight lifting, Mitt Romney better have big arms to lift the bags of money his campaign has raked in. Finally, if there's one Olympic sport our leaders know all too well, it's gymnastics. Not all of them can handle the flips. This was Gary Bower in 2000. But today's crop is adept at the verbal gymnastics, the contortions, turns and, yes, the twists.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: He's been twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business.
ROMNEY: Their opposition people look for anything they can find to distort, to twist and try and make negative.
BERMAN: With all that twisting, let's get these guys on the balance beam. Meanwhile, we can only hope they don't discover beach volleyball. America couldn't bear the outfits.
BERMAN: You know, it's also a good thing it's not winter or we would be talking about ice dancing. Now, in terms of what the candidates will be watching, we know President Obama met with the men's basketball team. We know he's a big fan of theirs. And Mitt Romney says he hopes to check out some swimming before he leaves London. And you could say he's already been working on his backstroke after this kerfuffle over the whole U.S./London ready thing -- Wolf.

I. TRUMP: Ivana's nobody and Ivana his first lady.

I. TRUMP: I was just offered to be American ambassador to Czech Republic. And Donald told me said, Ivana, if you want it, I give it to you. But I like my freedom, OK.

ANDY COHEN, EXECUTIVE PRODUCE, REAL HOUSEWIVES: I was watching this play out today and just thought, you know what, and I would like to be, you know, I'm here on CNN, open invitation to the first lady, to the honorary first lady Ivana Trump. I'd like to get Marla Maples in there. I think she maybe has unresolved issues. And I feel it would be great to have Ivanka Trump there as well. I will set up two couches, get this going, and just put me in the game, I can do this.
COOPER: We're going have more of my conversation with Andy at the 9:00 hour including tips from Andy's ""Housewives"" playbook. Up next the escalating fight between the president and the sitting Republican senator, a powerful sitting Republican senator who says the president is putting the country at risk of World War III.","President Trump's first wife, Ivana, referred to herself as the ""first lady"" in an interview, prompting a response from the actual First Lady, Melania Trump.

CNN-323083_38_Trump and Ivana's spat_model_E,"COOPER: It's an argument that would seem right at home on the ""Real Housewives of Washington"" except that series ended seasons ago. President Trump's first and third wives are in broiled in a public spat. That after the first wife Ivana called herself the first lady in an interview today. The actual First Lady Melania Trump and felt moved to put out a statement of her own and just a reminder, this all actually happened. Our Randi Kaye breaks it down.
DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: It is Melania.
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The shot across the bow came from Ivana Trump on ""Good Morning America"" this morning.
IVANA TRUMP, FORMER WIFE OF DONALD TRUMP: I have the direct numbers to White House but I no really want to call him there because Melania is there and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, because I'm basically first Trump wife, OK. I'm first lady.
KAYE (voice-over): As you might imagine, Ivana calling herself the first lady didn't sit so well with the real first lady. In a tersely worded statement, First Lady Melania Trump fired back through her spokesperson. ""Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the president. She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books."" The statement went on to say, ""There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex. This is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise."" That statement certainly a different tone than we heard from Melania Trump back in 2005.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know his exes?
MELANIA TRUMP, UNITED STATES FIRST LADY: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get along with them?
M. TRUMP: I don't see them much. I don't -- you know, we don't see them --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They were at the wedding though.
KAYE (voice-over): Ivana Trump and Donald Trump met more than four decades ago and were married eight months later. She is the mother of the president's three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric who would later become his second wife. Over the weekend, Ivana told CBS she doesn't speak to Marla Maples but that she gets along with Melania Trump, explaining her reasoning this way.
I. TRUMP: Ivana's nobody and Ivana his first lady.
KAYE (voice-over): First lady, a title Ivana took for herself just 24 hours later during another network interview. Ivana's shot at first lady ended when her marriage to Donald Trump ended. But as she tells it, she did have a chance at an ambassadorship.
I. TRUMP: I was just offered to be American ambassador to Czech Republic. And Donald told me said, Ivana, if you want it, I give it to you. But I like my freedom, OK. Why would I go and say bye-bye to Miami in the winter, bye-bye to San Tropez in summer? And bye-bye to spring and fall in New York. I have the perfect life.

President Trump's recent back and forth with the father of a UCLA basketball player has revived questions about the president and race. The president was outraged that this father LaVar Ball refused to thank him for helping free his son LiAngelo Ball from custody, one of three athletes arrested for shoplifting. The president called LaVar Ball, quote, an ungrateful fool and the poor man's version of Don King without hair all over Twitter who could have spent, quote, the next five to ten years during Thanksgiving with your son in China but no NBA contract to support you. So adding to that today, the ghost writer to the president's best- seller Art of the Deal is saying this about why the president crossed the line to cut down LaVar Ball.
TONY SCHWARTZ, TRUMP'S GHOSTWRITER FOR ART OF THE DEAL: I think Trump is half awed and half frightened by black people and his only way of dealing with them is to attack them. And on the other hand, I think he has a zero tolerance for any criticism of any kind.
BALDWIN: Let's start there. CNN political commentators Paris Dennard and Sally Kohn are with me. Happy thanksgiving first and foremost to both of you. Paris, you heard Tony Schwartz saying the president is half awed and half frightened by black people. What do you think that means and would you like to comment on that?
PARIS DENNARD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORS: I mean, first of all, Happy Thanksgiving. I think Tony is ridiculous in his statements. I find it interesting that after this man becomes the president of the United States is when he decides to really become so negative, rude and political. But the fact that President Trump is awed by African-American people is not a bad thing. I think a lot of people are awed by successful groups of people, people who are accomplished. I think the president likes and is awed by a lot of people who are successful, who are -- who are the best at their game, who strive and overcome obstacles and become number one, who are winners.
BALDWIN: Do we think that's how Tony Schwartz meant it?
DENNARD: I don't know if that's -- I don't know if that's how Tony Schwartz meant it. I doubt it. But that's how the president is. I've interacted with him many, many times. I've seen him with large groups of black people and that is not a man who is by any means frightened by African-Americans. I think that notion is absurd and I think it's highly offensive to have him equate that to this man. If you are a racist, you don't appoint or put the first African- American woman to be the -- your press secretary to the campaign. If you are a racist or you're afraid of black people, you don't invite the largest number of HBCU presidents and chancellors in your office to meet with them if you're afraid of black people or if you're somehow a racist. This is not something that is racist or someone who is a scared of black people does. And so I think these comments just reinforce a false narrative about this president because we were all surprised to see the president did so well with the African-American community. He has a long positive history with the black community going back for many, many years, many decades and it is continuing now with his agenda, especially when you look at the tax cut plan that will impact small business owners, as well as middle class Americans, which is a lot of African-Americans just like myself. So this is something that is unfortunate and I don't know why Tony is doing it, but I guess it's just for him to get more publicity off the back of the president of the United States.
BALDWIN: OK. Paris, that's how you see it. Sally Kohn, how do you see it?
SALLY KOHN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm glad Paris brought up a false narrative. I agree there is a false narrative here. The false narrative is about how we see racism in America today.

TONY SCHWARTZ, TRUMP'S GHOSTWRITER FOR ART OF THE DEAL: I think Trump is half awed and half frightened by black people and his only way of dealing with them is to attack them. And on the other hand, I think he has a zero tolerance for any criticism of any kind.
BALDWIN: Let's start there. CNN political commentators Paris Dennard and Sally Kohn are with me. Happy thanksgiving first and foremost to both of you. Paris, you heard Tony Schwartz saying the president is half awed and half frightened by black people. What do you think that means and would you like to comment on that?
PARIS DENNARD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORS: I mean, first of all, Happy Thanksgiving. I think Tony is ridiculous in his statements. I find it interesting that after this man becomes the president of the United States is when he decides to really become so negative, rude and political. But the fact that President Trump is awed by African-American people is not a bad thing. I think a lot of people are awed by successful groups of people, people who are accomplished. I think the president likes and is awed by a lot of people who are successful, who are -- who are the best at their game, who strive and overcome obstacles and become number one, who are winners.
BALDWIN: Do we think that's how Tony Schwartz meant it?
DENNARD: I don't know if that's -- I don't know if that's how Tony Schwartz meant it. I doubt it. But that's how the president is. I've interacted with him many, many times. I've seen him with large groups of black people and that is not a man who is by any means frightened by African-Americans. I think that notion is absurd and I think it's highly offensive to have him equate that to this man. If you are a racist, you don't appoint or put the first African- American woman to be the -- your press secretary to the campaign. If you are a racist or you're afraid of black people, you don't invite the largest number of HBCU presidents and chancellors in your office to meet with them if you're afraid of black people or if you're somehow a racist. This is not something that is racist or someone who is a scared of black people does. And so I think these comments just reinforce a false narrative about this president because we were all surprised to see the president did so well with the African-American community. He has a long positive history with the black community going back for many, many years, many decades and it is continuing now with his agenda, especially when you look at the tax cut plan that will impact small business owners, as well as middle class Americans, which is a lot of African-Americans just like myself. So this is something that is unfortunate and I don't know why Tony is doing it, but I guess it's just for him to get more publicity off the back of the president of the United States.

BALDWIN: OK. Paris, that's how you see it. Sally Kohn, how do you see it?
SALLY KOHN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm glad Paris brought up a false narrative. I agree there is a false narrative here. The false narrative is about how we see racism in America today. So let's be really clear about something, Thomas Jefferson when he wrote that all men should be created equal, hundreds of African-American slaves.","Slavery and racism have been a significant part of American history, with Thomas Jefferson being one of the founding fathers who held slaves and believed in the inferiority of African Americans. This has shaped the country's past and present, with systemic racism and inequality persisting.",0,val,TofuEval
CNN-326771_14_Slavery and racism in America_model_D,"BALDWIN: And we're back on this Thanksgiving Thursday. Happy Thanksgiving to you. I'm Brooke Baldwin. President Trump's recent back and forth with the father of a UCLA basketball player has revived questions about the president and race. The president was outraged that this father LaVar Ball refused to thank him for helping free his son LiAngelo Ball from custody, one of three athletes arrested for shoplifting. The president called LaVar Ball, quote, an ungrateful fool and the poor man's version of Don King without hair all over Twitter who could have spent, quote, the next five to ten years during Thanksgiving with your son in China but no NBA contract to support you. So adding to that today, the ghost writer to the president's best- seller Art of the Deal is saying this about why the president crossed the line to cut down LaVar Ball.
TONY SCHWARTZ, TRUMP'S GHOSTWRITER FOR ART OF THE DEAL: I think Trump is half awed and half frightened by black people and his only way of dealing with them is to attack them. And on the other hand, I think he has a zero tolerance for any criticism of any kind.
BALDWIN: Let's start there. CNN political commentators Paris Dennard and Sally Kohn are with me. Happy thanksgiving first and foremost to both of you. Paris, you heard Tony Schwartz saying the president is half awed and half frightened by black people. What do you think that means and would you like to comment on that?
PARIS DENNARD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORS: I mean, first of all, Happy Thanksgiving. I think Tony is ridiculous in his statements. I find it interesting that after this man becomes the president of the United States is when he decides to really become so negative, rude and political. But the fact that President Trump is awed by African-American people is not a bad thing. I think a lot of people are awed by successful groups of people, people who are accomplished. I think the president likes and is awed by a lot of people who are successful, who are -- who are the best at their game, who strive and overcome obstacles and become number one, who are winners.
BALDWIN: Do we think that's how Tony Schwartz meant it?
DENNARD: I don't know if that's -- I don't know if that's how Tony Schwartz meant it. I doubt it. But that's how the president is. I've interacted with him many, many times. I've seen him with large groups of black people and that is not a man who is by any means frightened by African-Americans. I think that notion is absurd and I think it's highly offensive to have him equate that to this man. If you are a racist, you don't appoint or put the first African- American woman to be the -- your press secretary to the campaign. If you are a racist or you're afraid of black people, you don't invite the largest number of HBCU presidents and chancellors in your office to meet with them if you're afraid of black people or if you're somehow a racist. This is not something that is racist or someone who is a scared of black people does. And so I think these comments just reinforce a false narrative about this president because we were all surprised to see the president did so well with the African-American community. He has a long positive history with the black community going back for many, many years, many decades and it is continuing now with his agenda, especially when you look at the tax cut plan that will impact small business owners, as well as middle class Americans, which is a lot of African-Americans just like myself.

The Navy has identified three sailors who have been missing since their plane crashed off the coast of Japan Wednesday. Here are their faces. It comes after they notified families that search-and-rescue efforts ended. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now. Polo, tell us about these three young men.
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the personal side of these heroes. The Navy had been holding off releasing information until they could notify families. Today, this information released by the government. I want to tell you a little about these men, now identified by the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Steven Combs, a man from Florida, assigned to provider's fleet of logistical support squadron 30. Airman Matthew Chialastri from Louisiana was assigned to ""USS Ronald Reagan,"" as was Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso from Florida. They did not survive the crash earlier this week. They were among 11 crew and passengers on a Navy transport plane that crashed as it approached an air carrier Wednesday in the western Pacific. At least eight of those individuals were rescued by officials, both from Japan and the U.S. They covered about 1,000 nautical miles in a desperate search for any sign of the three men. Sadly, presumed dead by the Navy and now family members are aware, their sons will not come home. This investigation is on-going now, Ana. We understand Japanese defense minister said they believe engine trouble may be to blame, but the investigation is still on-going.
CABRERA: And yet, this is a tough year for the Navy, the Seventh fleet specifically, lost 17 servicemembers in a number of different incidents. What's going on?
SANDOVAL: Seventeen men and women there. Important to point out this has happened over time. When you look at the list, Ana, it is tragic to see lives are lost after these incidents. In August, the deadly collision with the ""USS McCain"" and a merchant ship. That left at least 10 sailors dead. Back in June, a missile destroy are, ""USS Fitzgerald"" collided with a cargo ship, seven dead there. Two fatal incidents out of the list were later determined to be, quote, ""avoidable,"" and also the result of, quote, ""numerous failings occurred on the part of leadership,"" according to a Navy report. So clearly some serious issues there. Some top Navy officers lost jobs over this. Important to point out with the loss of the three men, it seems this was an accident. They're still investigating. As we mentioned, they believe engine trouble may be to blame. So a different situation. Nonetheless, tragic for the three men not coming home.

CABRERA: Infighting in the Trump administration is threatening to overshadow a major global summit. State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?
MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, ""They,"" meaning Tillerson and staff, ""won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka."" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, ""Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump."" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, ""The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters."" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either. Michelle Kosinski, CNN, Washington.

POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the personal side of these heroes. The Navy had been holding off releasing information until they could notify families. Today, this information released by the government. I want to tell you a little about these men, now identified by the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Steven Combs, a man from Florida, assigned to provider's fleet of logistical support squadron 30. Airman Matthew Chialastri from Louisiana was assigned to ""USS Ronald Reagan,"" as was Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso from Florida. They did not survive the crash earlier this week. They were among 11 crew and passengers on a Navy transport plane that crashed as it approached an air carrier Wednesday in the western Pacific. At least eight of those individuals were rescued by officials, both from Japan and the U.S. They covered about 1,000 nautical miles in a desperate search for any sign of the three men. Sadly, presumed dead by the Navy and now family members are aware, their sons will not come home. This investigation is on-going now, Ana. We understand Japanese defense minister said they believe engine trouble may be to blame, but the investigation is still on-going.
CABRERA: And yet, this is a tough year for the Navy, the Seventh fleet specifically, lost 17 servicemembers in a number of different incidents. What's going on?
SANDOVAL: Seventeen men and women there. Important to point out this has happened over time. When you look at the list, Ana, it is tragic to see lives are lost after these incidents. In August, the deadly collision with the ""USS McCain"" and a merchant ship. That left at least 10 sailors dead. Back in June, a missile destroy are, ""USS Fitzgerald"" collided with a cargo ship, seven dead there. Two fatal incidents out of the list were later determined to be, quote, ""avoidable,"" and also the result of, quote, ""numerous failings occurred on the part of leadership,"" according to a Navy report. So clearly some serious issues there. Some top Navy officers lost jobs over this. Important to point out with the loss of the three men, it seems this was an accident. They're still investigating. As we mentioned, they believe engine trouble may be to blame. So a different situation. Nonetheless, tragic for the three men not coming home.

CABRERA: Infighting in the Trump administration is threatening to overshadow a major global summit. State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?
MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, ""They,"" meaning Tillerson and staff, ""won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka."" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, ""Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump."" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, ""The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters."" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either. Michelle Kosinski, CNN, Washington.

State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?
MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, ""They,"" meaning Tillerson and staff, ""won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka."" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, ""Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump."" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, ""The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters."" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either. Michelle Kosinski, CNN, Washington.

The Navy has identified three sailors who have been missing since their plane crashed off the coast of Japan Wednesday. Here are their faces. It comes after they notified families that search-and-rescue efforts ended. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now. Polo, tell us about these three young men.
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the personal side of these heroes. The Navy had been holding off releasing information until they could notify families. Today, this information released by the government. I want to tell you a little about these men, now identified by the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Steven Combs, a man from Florida, assigned to provider's fleet of logistical support squadron 30. Airman Matthew Chialastri from Louisiana was assigned to ""USS Ronald Reagan,"" as was Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso from Florida. They did not survive the crash earlier this week. They were among 11 crew and passengers on a Navy transport plane that crashed as it approached an air carrier Wednesday in the western Pacific. At least eight of those individuals were rescued by officials, both from Japan and the U.S. They covered about 1,000 nautical miles in a desperate search for any sign of the three men. Sadly, presumed dead by the Navy and now family members are aware, their sons will not come home. This investigation is on-going now, Ana. We understand Japanese defense minister said they believe engine trouble may be to blame, but the investigation is still on-going.
CABRERA: And yet, this is a tough year for the Navy, the Seventh fleet specifically, lost 17 servicemembers in a number of different incidents. What's going on?
SANDOVAL: Seventeen men and women there. Important to point out this has happened over time. When you look at the list, Ana, it is tragic to see lives are lost after these incidents. In August, the deadly collision with the ""USS McCain"" and a merchant ship. That left at least 10 sailors dead. Back in June, a missile destroy are, ""USS Fitzgerald"" collided with a cargo ship, seven dead there. Two fatal incidents out of the list were later determined to be, quote, ""avoidable,"" and also the result of, quote, ""numerous failings occurred on the part of leadership,"" according to a Navy report. So clearly some serious issues there. Some top Navy officers lost jobs over this. Important to point out with the loss of the three men, it seems this was an accident. They're still investigating. As we mentioned, they believe engine trouble may be to blame. So a different situation. Nonetheless, tragic for the three men not coming home.

The Navy has identified three sailors who have been missing since their plane crashed off the coast of Japan Wednesday. Here are their faces. It comes after they notified families that search-and-rescue efforts ended. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now. Polo, tell us about these three young men.
POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the personal side of these heroes. The Navy had been holding off releasing information until they could notify families. Today, this information released by the government. I want to tell you a little about these men, now identified by the U.S. Navy as Lieutenant Steven Combs, a man from Florida, assigned to provider's fleet of logistical support squadron 30. Airman Matthew Chialastri from Louisiana was assigned to ""USS Ronald Reagan,"" as was Airman Apprentice Bryan Grosso from Florida. They did not survive the crash earlier this week. They were among 11 crew and passengers on a Navy transport plane that crashed as it approached an air carrier Wednesday in the western Pacific. At least eight of those individuals were rescued by officials, both from Japan and the U.S. They covered about 1,000 nautical miles in a desperate search for any sign of the three men. Sadly, presumed dead by the Navy and now family members are aware, their sons will not come home. This investigation is on-going now, Ana. We understand Japanese defense minister said they believe engine trouble may be to blame, but the investigation is still on-going.
CABRERA: And yet, this is a tough year for the Navy, the Seventh fleet specifically, lost 17 servicemembers in a number of different incidents. What's going on?
SANDOVAL: Seventeen men and women there. Important to point out this has happened over time. When you look at the list, Ana, it is tragic to see lives are lost after these incidents. In August, the deadly collision with the ""USS McCain"" and a merchant ship. That left at least 10 sailors dead. Back in June, a missile destroy are, ""USS Fitzgerald"" collided with a cargo ship, seven dead there. Two fatal incidents out of the list were later determined to be, quote, ""avoidable,"" and also the result of, quote, ""numerous failings occurred on the part of leadership,"" according to a Navy report. So clearly some serious issues there. Some top Navy officers lost jobs over this. Important to point out with the loss of the three men, it seems this was an accident. They're still investigating. As we mentioned, they believe engine trouble may be to blame. So a different situation. Nonetheless, tragic for the three men not coming home.
CABRERA: Polo Sandoval, thank you.
SANDOVAL: Thanks, Ana.
CABRERA: Infighting in the Trump administration is threatening to overshadow a major global summit. State Department officials tell CNN the U.S. is not sending a high-level delegation to next week's Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India. The main reason, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson doesn't want to support Ivanka Trump, who is leading the U.S. delegation at this event. CNN senior diplomatic correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, broke this story and joins us with more details -- Michelle?
MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. It is a big event, put on by the State Department. This year, first daughter and senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, is headlining it. She leaves this weekend. She was invited by the Indian prime minister. And the theme is women's entrepreneurship. What we are hearing from several sources, including senior ones in the State Department, as well as the White House, Rex Tillerson and his inner circle don't want to send senior people because they don't love the idea of Ivanka Trump leading the U.S. delegation here. From a senior State Department official, ""They,"" meaning Tillerson and staff, ""won't send someone senior because they don't want to bolster Ivanka."" Another rift at a time Rex Tillerson doesn't need more problems with the president. From a source close to the White House, ""Rex doesn't like that he is supposed to be the top diplomat and Jared and Ivanka stepped all over him. So now he is not sending someone from the State Department and not supporting Ivanka Trump."" When you look at this event in past years, President Obama attended once, Secretary of State Kerry last year, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state. But originally, the acting assistant secretary for the region was slated to be on the trip. She was then pulled by Tillerson and staff. When I asked a spokesperson, who are the senior people going on the trip, the list hasn't been officially published, they did give me a short list of the top U.S. government officials, but none of them were from the State Department. There was an ambassador, but that person is already in India. You could say, all right, this event was an Obama-era creation, the current State Department is trying to slash its budget left and right, and there's no permanent assistant secretary. But the answers back from sources, if you send a smaller delegation, fine. Wouldn't you send senior people and cut back in other ways? We did get an on-the-record statement from the State Department and it says, ""The department is committed to supporting women's economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. This summit is a prime opportunity to showcase the importance of these themes. The summit is really about the more than 1500 entrepreneurs, investors and supporters."" But they're obviously not commenting on this perceived Tillerson's Ivanka snub, and not denying this either. Michelle Kosinski, CNN, Washington.

So let's go live to Moscow now and bring in CNN's Phil Black. So Phil, sometimes the Russians retaliate for these things. In the past, they haven't.

PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russia is saying Michelle that the ball is in your court to the United States because they have chosen to match those expulsions as you detailed there, match the closure of the consulate -- in this case, Saint Petersburg. They believe that's the reasonable response but they say that they will take more action against the United States if the U.S. acts against Russia's interests any further. And the U.S., of course, has said well, we reserve the right to take further actions as well. So it remains to be seen if this draws a line under this current round of tit for tat diplomatic expulsions of whether there is still more action to be seen. But it reinforces what we've come to realize is that this is a historic low in relations between Russia and the United States. Interestingly here, for all the anger directed at the United States over these expulsions there is very little criticism of President Trump himself. There is still a belief here that President Trump would improve relations with Russia if he were allowed to, but Russian officials believe that he is held back -- restricted by an anti- Russian political class in the United States -- Michelle.

That ended a 9- quarter winning streak, the longest in 20 years. Right now, global stocks are higher. AT&T's antitrust trial continues and one of the Justice Department's own witnesses may have done damage to its case. The DOJ suing to block AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, the parent of CNN. It claims the merger could hurt rival companies. How? By withholding networks like CNN and HBO during negotiations. But a Comcast exec undercut that argument saying he has no reason to believe the deal would impact future negotiations with Time Warner. Walmart may buy health insurer Humana. That's according to ""The Wall Street Journal."" Now, it's the latest in a recent series of huge health care mergers. Last year, the Justice Department blocked two major tie-ups between insurance companies. It cited antitrust concerns. So now, insurers are seeking different dance partners if you will. For example, CVS pharmacy will buy Aetna. Walmart is already made forays into health care with its pharmacy business but acquiring Humana will give it far greater clout. iPhone users can now turn off a controversial feature that slows down older phones. Apple just updated its mobile operating system and it includes a laundry list of new features and fixes, like the ability to disable a feature that slowed down older phones. Apple previously admitted to slowing older models to save the battery, outraging their customers. Apple also added some very timely privacy features allowing customers to see all the data Apple collects and what the company uses it for, my friend.

So let's go live to Moscow now and bring in CNN's Phil Black. So Phil, sometimes the Russians retaliate for these things. In the past, they haven't.

PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Russia is saying Michelle that the ball is in your court to the United States because they have chosen to match those expulsions as you detailed there, match the closure of the consulate -- in this case, Saint Petersburg. They believe that's the reasonable response but they say that they will take more action against the United States if the U.S. acts against Russia's interests any further. And the U.S., of course, has said well, we reserve the right to take further actions as well. So it remains to be seen if this draws a line under this current round of tit for tat diplomatic expulsions of whether there is still more action to be seen. But it reinforces what we've come to realize is that this is a historic low in relations between Russia and the United States. Interestingly here, for all the anger directed at the United States over these expulsions there is very little criticism of President Trump himself. There is still a belief here that President Trump would improve relations with Russia if he were allowed to, but Russian officials believe that he is held back -- restricted by an anti- Russian political class in the United States -- Michelle.

Interestingly here, for all the anger directed at the United States over these expulsions there is very little criticism of President Trump himself.

That's according to ""The Wall Street Journal."" Now, it's the latest in a recent series of huge health care mergers.

For example, CVS pharmacy will buy Aetna. Walmart is already made forays into health care with its pharmacy business but acquiring Humana will give it far greater clout. iPhone users can now turn off a controversial feature that slows down older phones. Apple just updated its mobile operating system and it includes a laundry list of new features and fixes, like the ability to disable a feature that slowed down older phones.

CNN-349759_34_Administration officials and truth in the White House_Model-Extra,"SCIUTTO: The Republican candidate for Florida's governor under fire once again. Just days after Congressman Ron DeSantis was accused of using a racist term, the ""Washington Post"" reports that DeSantis spoke at multiple racially charged events, this dating back to 2013. At these conferences, you'd hear hundreds of people, many of the speakers right-wing speakers, but also some of them known racists, bigots, Milo Yiannopoulos, Sebastian Gorka, who's had anti-Muslim positions. CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns, joins me now. So first of all, at these events, you have a variety of viewpoints, many from the right, certainly not all racists and not all bigoted, but those kinds of voices seem to be a regular feature at these events.
JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think it's important for a variety of reasons. Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to ""monkey up the state."" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the ""Washington Post"" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.
SCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.
JOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.
SCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.
JOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.
SCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.
JOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.
SCIUTTO: Right. Joe Johns, thanks very much for clearing up for us. That is it for me today, Jim Sciutto, sitting in for Wolf. NEWSROOM with Brooke Baldwin starts right now.
BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: All right. Hi, there. I'm Brooke Baldwin. Thank you so much for being with me. We are minutes away from the first White House briefing in nearly three weeks. It comes as President Trump claims the White House is a smooth-running machine, despite the fact that his own vice president has offered to take a lie detector test. It's to prove he did not write that withering ""New York Times"" opinion piece, slamming the president, and as administration officials try to figure out which one of their own is not telling the truth. The president is calling Bob Woodward a liar.

CNN-349759_34_Administration officials and truth in the White House_model_A,"SCIUTTO: The Republican candidate for Florida's governor under fire once again. Just days after Congressman Ron DeSantis was accused of using a racist term, the ""Washington Post"" reports that DeSantis spoke at multiple racially charged events, this dating back to 2013. At these conferences, you'd hear hundreds of people, many of the speakers right-wing speakers, but also some of them known racists, bigots, Milo Yiannopoulos, Sebastian Gorka, who's had anti-Muslim positions. CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns, joins me now. So first of all, at these events, you have a variety of viewpoints, many from the right, certainly not all racists and not all bigoted, but those kinds of voices seem to be a regular feature at these events.
JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think it's important for a variety of reasons. Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to ""monkey up the state."" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the ""Washington Post"" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.
SCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.
JOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.
SCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.
JOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.
SCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.
JOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.

CNN-349759_34_Bob Woodward's book “Fear“_model_A,"SCIUTTO: The Republican candidate for Florida's governor under fire once again. Just days after Congressman Ron DeSantis was accused of using a racist term, the ""Washington Post"" reports that DeSantis spoke at multiple racially charged events, this dating back to 2013. At these conferences, you'd hear hundreds of people, many of the speakers right-wing speakers, but also some of them known racists, bigots, Milo Yiannopoulos, Sebastian Gorka, who's had anti-Muslim positions. CNN's senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns, joins me now. So first of all, at these events, you have a variety of viewpoints, many from the right, certainly not all racists and not all bigoted, but those kinds of voices seem to be a regular feature at these events.
JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. And I think it's important for a variety of reasons. Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to ""monkey up the state."" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the ""Washington Post"" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.
SCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.
JOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.
SCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.
JOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.
SCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.
JOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.

The president is calling Bob Woodward a liar. The acclaimed journalist, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist of Watergate fame, debuts his Trump tell-all, ""Fear"" -- the name of his book -- tomorrow. And the president is discrediting Woodward's account of an administration in an unprecedented crisis. Trump tweeted, the Woodward book is a, quote, ""scam,"" and a ""joke"" that should not be taken with a grain of salt. And here is what he says about Woodward.

Number one, because, right now -- and you have to underscore this -- he's running against an African-American candidate, Andrew Gillum, who's the Tallahassee mayor, and he makes a comment, for example, on television, saying, we don't want to ""monkey up the state."" And the question, of course, was whether that was a racist comment or not. He said it wasn't intended to be racist. But now you overlay that with this disclosure in the ""Washington Post"" that he's appeared four times before this group, organized by a conservative who has brought in these types of viewpoints, repeatedly. Then it starts to paint a bit of a more of a picture. And also important, I think, because the African-American community, already galvanized by the possibility of first African-American governor for the state of Florida, and now has these questions about the Republican candidate.
SCIUTTO: And the point about DeSantis -- and some of this came up when he used the racially charged term -- is that, here's an experienced politician, sitting Congressman, I believe he's a military vet.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: Smart guy, right? But he's been -- if he's been going to these events, going back to 2013, none of this should be a surprise to him, right? You wouldn't go to the event and not know the kind of stuff that is being said.
JOHNS: Right. And the question becomes whether this is all a wink and a nod to bring out those voters who support right-wing notions. Of course, he's also considered a very big Donald Trump supporter.
SCIUTTO: So he's resigned his seat. He's also not running again for his congressional seat. But we're early September.
JOHNS: Right.
SCIUTTO: So until that election, there's been several weeks here, where no one's sitting in that seat.
JOHNS: Precisely. And Florida is trying to figure out what to do. They are planning a conference call this afternoon to determine whether or not there ought to be a special election to have somebody in that seat, the sixth district, through the end of December, into the beginning of January, when the new Congress is sworn in. Because the question is whether there's enough time, particularly, to get military ballots out, which have to go out 45 days before the election, and what are they going to do? Because somebody's got to be in that seat, presumably, if they can, until January.
SCIUTTO: But there are already candidates in place, Democratic and Republican, to fill that seat in the regular general election.
JOHNS: Right. The primary was the 28th of August. There's a Republican, there's a Democrat, and DeSantis was presumed to be not running.

CNN-388107_45_Documents subpoenaed_Model-Extra,"BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.
BLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.
BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.
BLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.
BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in ""The New Yorker"" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: ""I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody."" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.
BLITZER: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you so much.
BLITZER: All right, just ahead, we're going to have much more on Rudy Giuliani unplugged when it comes to Ukraine. Why is he apparently admitting he wanted the former U.S. ambassador ousted, so he could freely dig up dirt for the -- on the Bidens? Plus, after two crashes, why is Boeing now halting, halting production of the 737 MAX?",Congressman Krishnamoorthi says Rudy Giuliani admitted to pushing out the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine to further Trump's political interests. Krishnamoorthi believes documents subpoenaed from Giuliani could provide insight but have not yet been received. He thinks witnesses should be examined only after documents are reviewed.,1,val,TofuEval

BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in ""The New Yorker"" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: ""I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody."" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.

REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.
BLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.
BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.

BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.
BLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.
BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in ""The New Yorker"" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: ""I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody."" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.

CNN-388107_45_Ukraine policy_model_C,"BLITZER: Tonight, House Democrats are accusing President Trump of committing multiple federal crimes, including bribery, even though they were not explicitly referenced in the articles of impeachment. We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of both the Intelligence and Oversight committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.
REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Thank you.
BLITZER: And let's walk through what the House of Representatives is about to do. They will take a historic vote to impeach the president on Wednesday. Walk us through what will happen.
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, there are two articles of impeachment, one for abuse of power and the other for obstruction of Congress. And so there will be a vote on these articles. Obviously, I don't think that the speaker is doing anything other than directing people to vote per their conscience and their constituents. And I think that's what people are going to do on Wednesday.
BLITZER: Your Republican colleague Will Hurd of Texas says, you can vote against impeachment, but still disagree with some of the president's behavior. How do you respond to that?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I respectfully disagree with my colleague, in the sense that this type of behavior is precisely why the framers of the Constitution incorporated an impeachment provision within the Constitution. The framers were deeply concerned about foreign powers getting involved in the domestic affairs of America. And, specifically, they would have been extremely concerned about pressuring a foreign power or getting a foreign power to get involved in our elections. In this particular case, that's exactly what the evidence shows that the president, over a pattern of -- over several months exhibited a pattern of conduct in which he pressured the Ukrainians to basically investigate his political rivals, thereby compromising national security and the integrity of our elections, Wolf.
BLITZER: What does it say to you, Congressman, that not a single Republican in the House is expected to vote for either of these articles of impeachment?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, Justin Amash, I guess, was a Republican before he disagreed with the president. I think that he will probably vote in favor of the articles. That being said, at this point, I think everyone has to vote their conscience and has to do the right thing and put the Constitution above party and politics. That's extremely important.
BLITZER: Should Justin Amash, who is now an independent member of the House, serve as an impeachment case manager, a manager in the course of the trial in the Senate, as some of your Democratic colleagues are recommending?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't want to speculate on who the manager is going to be. I know that Nancy Pelosi is going to assemble a team that knows the facts and brings credit to the House in presenting the case in the Senate.
BLITZER: In an interview, a new interview, as we have been reporting, in ""The New Yorker"" magazine, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, made this admission about his campaign to push out the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. He says this. He says: ""I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody."" So, what do you think? How significant is that admission by Giuliani?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's very significant. And that's what the evidence showed during the hearings, that Rudy Giuliani and the president basically pushed Ambassador Yovanovitch away to basically install Rudy Giuliani in charge of Ukraine policy, along with the three amigos, Ambassador Sondland, Rick Perry and Volker, Ambassador Volker. And, basically, what they sought to do was to basically commandeer Ukraine policy in favor of Donald Trump's political ambitions. And, as I said before, that's a shadow foreign policy. That is not necessarily in the best interests of the country, but maybe in the best interest of Rudy Giuliani's clients and Donald Trump's political agenda. But that's not the way that our foreign policy should ever be run.
BLITZER: Should Giuliani be called as a witness?
KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't know. We have never received the documents that were subpoenaed from Giuliani. I personally -- I'm speaking for myself. I personally believe that we should always view documents from a witness before they are examined in terms of their live testimony. And so I'd like to see those documents first.

CNN-41953_24_Anthrax diagnosis_Model-Extra,"AARON BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: The day, of course, began with news -- at least began for us with news that a CBS employee, an assistant to CBS news anchor Dan Rather has been diagnosed with the skin form of anthrax. That's where we'll begin this hour's coverage. Michael Okwu joins us with more on that -- Michael.
MICHAEL OKWU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, good afternoon. Apparently, she is a young woman. And she is on antibiotics. Officials here say that she's responding well to those antibiotics and that she is resting comfortably at home. Now, CBS officials say that one of her duties is to open mail for Mr. Rather, but it is unclear how she contracted anthrax. There's absolutely no evidence at this point, they say, that any of the mail or any of the envelopes received here in the past couple weeks was suspicious. And there's no indication at this time that anyone else at CBS was exposed to anthrax. Now this morning, Mayor Giuliani at a press conference said that she noticed swelling on October 1. After she noticed this swelling, she went to her medical team, her doctors, who prescribed penicillin for her on the fourth. But last Friday when she heard about the news at NBC, the case of anthrax there, she became nervous and contacted health officials. She was then tested and found positive for anthrax and was given Cipro. Authorities are confident, however, that this is an isolated case.
MAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK: She is recovering, if not recovered completely. She responded well to both the penicillin and the Cipro and should be all right. And that she works at CBS. She handles mail. And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.
OKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.
BROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?
OKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room. And that's going to be going on for the better part of this afternoon -- Aaron.
BROWN: Michael, thank you. Michael Okwu on the CBS story. On the subject of mail and mail rooms: The Associated Press is just now reporting that a New Jersey postal worker has now tested positive for exposure to anthrax. We don't know -- at least, I don't know where that postal worker worked. But we do know that a couple of the letters that contained anthrax were mailed out of New Jersey. And we recall that two New Jersey postal workers had complained earlier in the week of flu-like symptoms, which may have been the flu or may not have been the flu, of course. In any case, one worker, according to AP, has now tested positively for exposure to anthrax. And again, we make the distinction, we'll make it often, there is a huge difference between being exposed to anthrax and actually contracting anthrax. It is not a little distinction. It can be a life and death distinction. And so we're very careful in how we say this. The postal worker exposed. Judy, good afternoon.

MICHAEL OKWU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, good afternoon. Apparently, she is a young woman. And she is on antibiotics. Officials here say that she's responding well to those antibiotics and that she is resting comfortably at home. Now, CBS officials say that one of her duties is to open mail for Mr. Rather, but it is unclear how she contracted anthrax. There's absolutely no evidence at this point, they say, that any of the mail or any of the envelopes received here in the past couple weeks was suspicious. And there's no indication at this time that anyone else at CBS was exposed to anthrax. Now this morning, Mayor Giuliani at a press conference said that she noticed swelling on October 1. After she noticed this swelling, she went to her medical team, her doctors, who prescribed penicillin for her on the fourth. But last Friday when she heard about the news at NBC, the case of anthrax there, she became nervous and contacted health officials. She was then tested and found positive for anthrax and was given Cipro. Authorities are confident, however, that this is an isolated case.
MAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK: She is recovering, if not recovered completely. She responded well to both the penicillin and the Cipro and should be all right. And that she works at CBS. She handles mail. And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.
OKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.
BROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?
OKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room. And that's going to be going on for the better part of this afternoon -- Aaron.
BROWN: Michael, thank you. Michael Okwu on the CBS story. On the subject of mail and mail rooms: The Associated Press is just now reporting that a New Jersey postal worker has now tested positive for exposure to anthrax. We don't know -- at least, I don't know where that postal worker worked. But we do know that a couple of the letters that contained anthrax were mailed out of New Jersey. And we recall that two New Jersey postal workers had complained earlier in the week of flu-like symptoms, which may have been the flu or may not have been the flu, of course. In any case, one worker, according to AP, has now tested positively for exposure to anthrax. And again, we make the distinction, we'll make it often, there is a huge difference between being exposed to anthrax and actually contracting anthrax. It is not a little distinction. It can be a life and death distinction. And so we're very careful in how we say this. The postal worker exposed. Judy, good afternoon.

MICHAEL OKWU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, good afternoon. Apparently, she is a young woman. And she is on antibiotics. Officials here say that she's responding well to those antibiotics and that she is resting comfortably at home. Now, CBS officials say that one of her duties is to open mail for Mr. Rather, but it is unclear how she contracted anthrax. There's absolutely no evidence at this point, they say, that any of the mail or any of the envelopes received here in the past couple weeks was suspicious. And there's no indication at this time that anyone else at CBS was exposed to anthrax. Now this morning, Mayor Giuliani at a press conference said that she noticed swelling on October 1. After she noticed this swelling, she went to her medical team, her doctors, who prescribed penicillin for her on the fourth. But last Friday when she heard about the news at NBC, the case of anthrax there, she became nervous and contacted health officials. She was then tested and found positive for anthrax and was given Cipro. Authorities are confident, however, that this is an isolated case.
MAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), NEW YORK: She is recovering, if not recovered completely. She responded well to both the penicillin and the Cipro and should be all right. And that she works at CBS. She handles mail. And no one else at CBS, during this very lengthy time period, which is what it is, since October 1, from what we can tell, has any symptoms. So there's no indication that anything got spread to anyone else.
OKWU: We've counted about two dozen representatives from the CDC who have entered this building. At this point, of course, CBS is still operational. It is still open. And there are just throngs of media here -- Aaron.
BROWN: And just -- Michael, just to reiterate one point -- are CBS News employees being tested now, or is the assumption that if it had happened we'd already know?
OKWU: Well, they -- the authorities are very confident that if this had happened that we would already know. But there are people in the mail room which, of course, seems to be the pattern these days who are being tested. And they are conducting tests on that mail room, environmental tests for that space, as well as environmental tests for spaces beyond the mail room.

CNN-62362_33_Haitian migrants_Model-Extra,"MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR: More than 200 illegal immigrants from Haiti are now at a detention center today in Florida, awaiting processing. The Haitians were rounded up yesterday after many of them jumped from a packed wooden boat into the surf off of Key Biscayne. Immigration authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, as Susan Candiotti reports now live from Miami. Susan, it was a wild scene to watch as it developed.
SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was. A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.
REP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land. My blood has been transferred to them, governor.
BUSH: Congresswoman, I appreciate it.
QUESTION: I love them.
BUSH: I respect your position.
QUESTION: Please, call him, governor, and ask him to please -- you can do it.
BUSH: Thank you.
QUESTION: We can't do it. The Congress can't do it. We tried our best. We can't do it. If you call him...
BUSH: You know, we worked together in 1998 to change the immigration laws. With your leadership, that occurred to provide for more just treatment of Haitians. My position is, as I stated, if people have a well-founded fear of persecution, they should be allowed into the community, out of Krome and they should be able to pursue those remedies through administrative...
QUESTION: Tell your brother they can be released right now. You can.
CANDIOTTI: Well, Haitian Americans plan to keep drumming this issue as best they can. And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants. It's certainly an issue, Martin, that is not going to go away any time soon. It comes up time and again. And all kinds of questions being raised about it again. And not a good time, certainly, for Governor Jeb Bush during his re-election campaign.
SAVIDGE: That's what I was going to ask you about. You mention the issue of timing here. Jeb Bush in a very tight race and now this literally lands on his doorstep. What are the potential pitfalls for him?
CANDIOTTI: Reporter: well, certainly there could be major pitfalls for him in certain segments of the community. Those people who think that these migrants are being treated unfairly might decide to take up this issue and, you know, go against Governor Jeb Bush at the election polls. We have not heard yet, to the best of my knowledge, from his opponent, Democrat Jim McBride, who is running against Governor Jeb Bush. So we'll wait to see what happens as the day goes on.
SAVIDGE: We certainly will. Susan Candiotti reporting to us from Miami. Thank you very much. Center in Florida>",Over 200 Haitian migrants landed in Florida after jumping from a boat.

And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.
REP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land. My blood has been transferred to them, governor.

BUSH: You know, we worked together in 1998 to change the immigration laws. With your leadership, that occurred to provide for more just treatment of Haitians. My position is, as I stated, if people have a well-founded fear of persecution, they should be allowed into the community, out of Krome and they should be able to pursue those remedies through administrative...
QUESTION: Tell your brother they can be released right now. You can.
CANDIOTTI: Well, Haitian Americans plan to keep drumming this issue as best they can. And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants. It's certainly an issue, Martin, that is not going to go away any time soon. It comes up time and again. And all kinds of questions being raised about it again. And not a good time, certainly, for Governor Jeb Bush during his re-election campaign.
SAVIDGE: That's what I was going to ask you about. You mention the issue of timing here. Jeb Bush in a very tight race and now this literally lands on his doorstep. What are the potential pitfalls for him?
CANDIOTTI: Reporter: well, certainly there could be major pitfalls for him in certain segments of the community. Those people who think that these migrants are being treated unfairly might decide to take up this issue and, you know, go against Governor Jeb Bush at the election polls.

Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.
REP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land. My blood has been transferred to them, governor.

And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants. It's certainly an issue, Martin, that is not going to go away any time soon. It comes up time and again. And all kinds of questions being raised about it again.

A very, still emotionally and politically charged issue, as these more than 200, as you indicated, Haitian migrants making their way to the Miami shoreline yesterday afternoon. You saw these pictures, which are, as we said, quite remarkable. Men, women and children jumping from this boat, in shallow waters around Miami's Key Biscayne area and in fact wading to shore. Many of these people wearing their Sunday finest clothes as they made this treacherous journey from Haiti to the United States. Very controversial in this particular area because, you can see the crossing that they made. And they were at sea for many, many, many days. And it is controversial because of the difference between the way Haitian migrants, or example and Cuban migrants. Cubans, for the most part, are treated as political refugees. And if they reach the shores, they are automatically allowed to remain in the United States. That is not the case with Haitian migrants who most always are sent back because they are viewed as economic refugees. However, all of these migrants will be able to make their case. They hope, anyway, if they are able to hire lawyers and try to make a case, many of them, that they are political refugees, as well. Now, today there was a brief meeting set up during a campaign appearance by Governor Jeb Bush, who is, of course, campaigning for re-election here. And he made a stop at a local school in Miami. At that time, among the people who were there on the podium with him, Congressman Carrie Meek -- Congresswoman Carrie Meek who is a Democrat, and she directly approached the governor on this issue in a very dramatic way. Listen.
REP. CARRIE MEEK (D), FLORIDA: I came to ask you if you would call your brother and ask him to call INS to release the Haitians that are in detention. They don't need a new policy. All they have to do is call. The wet foot/dry foot policy will take effect. Those Haitians are standing on dry land. My blood has been transferred to them, governor.
BUSH: Congresswoman, I appreciate it.
QUESTION: I love them.
BUSH: I respect your position.
QUESTION: Please, call him, governor, and ask him to please -- you can do it.
BUSH: Thank you.
QUESTION: We can't do it. The Congress can't do it. We tried our best. We can't do it. If you call him...
BUSH: You know, we worked together in 1998 to change the immigration laws. With your leadership, that occurred to provide for more just treatment of Haitians. My position is, as I stated, if people have a well-founded fear of persecution, they should be allowed into the community, out of Krome and they should be able to pursue those remedies through administrative...
QUESTION: Tell your brother they can be released right now. You can.
CANDIOTTI: Well, Haitian Americans plan to keep drumming this issue as best they can. And there have been a number of demonstrations, a couple yesterday, one this morning, and another one scheduled outside the offices and headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services this afternoon as many people protest the treatment of these Haitian migrants. It's certainly an issue, Martin, that is not going to go away any time soon. It comes up time and again. And all kinds of questions being raised about it again. And not a good time, certainly, for Governor Jeb Bush during his re-election campaign.
SAVIDGE: That's what I was going to ask you about. You mention the issue of timing here. Jeb Bush in a very tight race and now this literally lands on his doorstep. What are the potential pitfalls for him?
CANDIOTTI: Reporter: well, certainly there could be major pitfalls for him in certain segments of the community. Those people who think that these migrants are being treated unfairly might decide to take up this issue and, you know, go against Governor Jeb Bush at the election polls. We have not heard yet, to the best of my knowledge, from his opponent, Democrat Jim McBride, who is running against Governor Jeb Bush. So we'll wait to see what happens as the day goes on.

CNN-65385_44_Criticism of Bush Administration's Approach_Model-Extra,"FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Topping our news this hour, North Korea's nuclear plans. While the Pyongyang government aims angry words at the United States, the Bush administration is sticking to plans of diplomacy. We check in with senior White House correspondent John King -- John.
JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, hello to you. The latest words from North Korea that are of concern to the Bush administration, talk in North Korea that perhaps it will resume missile tests. Tests of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. This, of course, on the heels of a decision of the North Korea government to restart a nuclear reactor that is critical to its nuclear weapon's program. North Korea also says it will withdraw from participating in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Bush administration approach under fire back here in the United States. The president has said he is willing to talk with North Korea but not negotiate. Mr. Bush says there will be no concessions, no incentives from the United States that North Korea must agree publicly to abandon the weapons program. Many key Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan who is a senior member of the Senate Arms Services Committee say that's a mistake. They say the Bush administration should sit down with North Korea, no conditions.
SEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's wrong, and there ought to be direct dialogue and at a high level. It doesn't mean you're going to capitulate. Doesn't mean you are going to give concessions. All it means is you're going to talk to people to avoid miscalculation, and so they know directly what is on our mind and we can hear from them what is directly on their mind.
KING: Also some criticism today from some key Republicans. The president has said repeatedly that he has no plans and no intention of any hostile action military action toward North Korea. Senator John McCain of Arizona says heading into any negotiations or any conversations, the president should keep all options on the table, including the prospect of military force.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: It is a clear and present danger to the United States of America, they've now developed at least two nuclear weapons. If they -- if this situation continues as it is, they will have six or eight more. That gives them an enormous amount of flexibility. They've tested a missile. It could strike Tokyo. And they're developing missiles that can strike the United States of America. The United States needs to take vigorous action with our allies. But if not, on our own.
KING: The Bush administration maintains it is confident all of this can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy. For now though, the Bush administration's direct diplomacy is aimed at not at North Korea, but at South Korea. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly is in Seoul, South Korea for talks with South Korean officials including South Korea's president elect. There's been some criticism of the administration from that key ally, from Seoul. In Seoul, they believe the Bush administration is taking too hard of a line when it comes to North Korea. Now, North Korean officials did met with a former Clinton administration diplomat, Bill Richardson, now the governor of New Mexico, over the weekend. Those North Korean officials, we are told, told Governor Richardson they would like to have meetings with Bush administration officials as soon as possible at the United Nations in New York. Senior administration officials telling us today there are no talks scheduled. They do not rule them out, though. Perhaps some contact in the near future, we are told, to watch for, but the administration holding to this bottom line. Says it will talk to North Korea, but only about getting a commitment from North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. White House officials say until that commitment comes, there can be no talk of any concessions, any economic aid, or any other aid or incentives from the United States -- Fredricka.

JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, hello to you. The latest words from North Korea that are of concern to the Bush administration, talk in North Korea that perhaps it will resume missile tests. Tests of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. This, of course, on the heels of a decision of the North Korea government to restart a nuclear reactor that is critical to its nuclear weapon's program. North Korea also says it will withdraw from participating in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Bush administration approach under fire back here in the United States. The president has said he is willing to talk with North Korea but not negotiate. Mr. Bush says there will be no concessions, no incentives from the United States that North Korea must agree publicly to abandon the weapons program. Many key Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan who is a senior member of the Senate Arms Services Committee say that's a mistake. They say the Bush administration should sit down with North Korea, no conditions.
SEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's wrong, and there ought to be direct dialogue and at a high level. It doesn't mean you're going to capitulate. Doesn't mean you are going to give concessions. All it means is you're going to talk to people to avoid miscalculation, and so they know directly what is on our mind and we can hear from them what is directly on their mind.
KING: Also some criticism today from some key Republicans. The president has said repeatedly that he has no plans and no intention of any hostile action military action toward North Korea. Senator John McCain of Arizona says heading into any negotiations or any conversations, the president should keep all options on the table, including the prospect of military force.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: It is a clear and present danger to the United States of America, they've now developed at least two nuclear weapons. If they -- if this situation continues as it is, they will have six or eight more. That gives them an enormous amount of flexibility. They've tested a missile. It could strike Tokyo. And they're developing missiles that can strike the United States of America. The United States needs to take vigorous action with our allies. But if not, on our own.
KING: The Bush administration maintains it is confident all of this can be resolved peacefully through diplomacy.

JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, hello to you. The latest words from North Korea that are of concern to the Bush administration, talk in North Korea that perhaps it will resume missile tests. Tests of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. This, of course, on the heels of a decision of the North Korea government to restart a nuclear reactor that is critical to its nuclear weapon's program. North Korea also says it will withdraw from participating in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. The Bush administration approach under fire back here in the United States. The president has said he is willing to talk with North Korea but not negotiate. Mr. Bush says there will be no concessions, no incentives from the United States that North Korea must agree publicly to abandon the weapons program. Many key Democrats, including Senator Carl Levin of Michigan who is a senior member of the Senate Arms Services Committee say that's a mistake. They say the Bush administration should sit down with North Korea, no conditions.
SEN. CARL LEVIN (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's wrong, and there ought to be direct dialogue and at a high level. It doesn't mean you're going to capitulate. Doesn't mean you are going to give concessions. All it means is you're going to talk to people to avoid miscalculation, and so they know directly what is on our mind and we can hear from them what is directly on their mind.
KING: Also some criticism today from some key Republicans. The president has said repeatedly that he has no plans and no intention of any hostile action military action toward North Korea. Senator John McCain of Arizona says heading into any negotiations or any conversations, the president should keep all options on the table, including the prospect of military force.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: It is a clear and present danger to the United States of America, they've now developed at least two nuclear weapons. If they -- if this situation continues as it is, they will have six or eight more. That gives them an enormous amount of flexibility. They've tested a missile. It could strike Tokyo. And they're developing missiles that can strike the United States of America. The United States needs to take vigorous action with our allies. But if not, on our own.

NPR-26378_23_Background check system_Model-Extra,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Next, we're going to talk about an uneasy alliance in the fight over gun control. The gun industry makes weapons. The National Rifle Association is a leading voice for gun rights. They share common interests, of course, but it's emerging that they may not always have the same opinions about fighting the change in gun laws.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?
PAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?
PAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?
PAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Are there specific reforms - if we want to call them that - that gun manufacturers would sign on to if the NRA was not in the way of them doing so?
PAUL BARRETT: It's more question of whether they would object. One of the main proposals pending before Congress, and in fact, the White House has identified this as its top priority, is to make the background check system comprehensive, so that it would be legally required for all gun transactions to go through some type of computerized background check.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mm-hmm.
PAUL BARRETT: In fact, the gun industry is basically agnostic on that point. It's not that they're going to stand up and cheer in favor of it, but almost their entire stock and trade is already done through the licensed background check system. So the gun industry would just basically stand by and say very little if it were purely up to them. But they're not going to stand up and get into a fight with Wayne LaPierre in public.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?
PAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?
PAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?
PAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Paul Barrett of Bloomberg Businessweek has been talking with gun makers.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What is it you think has been overlooked about the - whatever you want to call it - the gun lobby, the gun industry, gun rights advocates, what did you discover?
PAUL BARRETT: It's becoming almost conventional wisdom that the reason the NRA goes to such extremes is that it is driven by the gun industry. And in fact, that understanding is just incorrect. If anything, it is the NRA that sets the terms of the debate and the gun industry basically obediently follows along.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What are some things that the National Rifle Association has said in recent months that have caused people in the gun industry who talked to you to cringe?
PAUL BARRETT: Well, the most specific thing has been the series of performances by Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and longtime head of the NRA, who has taken the group to what I would describe as a new extreme in terms of its pugnacious stance in the wake of the Newtown Elementary School massacre. And I think many people in the gun industry, given a choice, would not take the conspiratorial sort of paranoid approach that LaPierre specializes in. That said, they are doing nothing to try to deter him - for two reasons. One, they're afraid of the consumer boycotts that the NRA can organize if it chooses. And two, the NRA's hype actually does benefit the gun industry.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Is that a real possibility, that the NRA could organize a boycott of Smith & Wesson or some other brand of firearm?
PAUL BARRETT: It's not just a real possibility; it's something that has happened in the past. In 2000, which really was the last time before the current round of debate that we had a live gun control debate at the national level. Smith and Wesson actually tried to step up and arrive at a truce with the Clinton administration and with government officials around the country who were suing the gun industry. And Smith & Wesson agreed to settle those lawsuits and to comply with an unprecedented level of regulation. The result of that was that the NRA, other gun rights groups, encouraged gun buyers to boycott Smith & Wesson. In the space of six to eight months, the company almost went out of business. Plants were shut down, production lines were closed, and ultimately, the company changed ownership, reneged on the settlement and was accepted back into the fold. This is not a theoretical possibility. This is what happens when you cross the NRA.

NPR-41366_4_Activities of Quds Force_Model-Extra,"MICHELE NORRIS, host: To learn a little bit more about the Quds Force that President Bush referred to so often in his press conference, we turn now to Karim Sadjadpour. He's an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group. And he's spent a lot of time studying the influence of Iran in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: And Karim Sadjadpour joins us now in the studio. So glad that you're with us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.

MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.","The Quds Force is an elite branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guards that conducts military and intelligence operations. They are highly trained and versatile, operating like the U.S. Navy Seals and CIA. Though under Iran's Supreme Leader, they have some autonomy. They are active in Iraq, Lebanon, and possibly Saudi Arabia, training militias and manipulating local populations to expand Iran's influence.",0,val,TofuEval

Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.

MICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim, thanks so much for coming in to talk to us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Thank you, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.","While Iran's Supreme Leader oversees the Quds Force, Iran's regime is dysfunctional with fragmented decision making. Different institutions act independently, and consensus building is required. Though Khamenei has constitutional control, the Quds Force does not directly report to him. Decision making in Tehran is complex.",0,val,TofuEval
NPR-41366_4_Control and decision-making in Tehran_model_A,"MICHELE NORRIS, host: To learn a little bit more about the Quds Force that President Bush referred to so often in his press conference, we turn now to Karim Sadjadpour. He's an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group. And he's spent a lot of time studying the influence of Iran in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: And Karim Sadjadpour joins us now in the studio. So glad that you're with us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran.

MICHELE NORRIS, host: Karim Sadjadpour is an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group.","The Quds Force, an elite branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, operates in Iraq. Through military and intelligence activities, as well as funding social programs, they exert influence. Though under Iran's Supreme Leader, the Quds Force has some autonomy. They also operate in Lebanon and may have influence in Saudi Arabia's Shiite eastern province.",1,val,TofuEval
NPR-41366_4_Influence of Iran in Iraq_model_A,"MICHELE NORRIS, host: To learn a little bit more about the Quds Force that President Bush referred to so often in his press conference, we turn now to Karim Sadjadpour. He's an analyst on Iran for the International Crisis Group. And he's spent a lot of time studying the influence of Iran in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: And Karim Sadjadpour joins us now in the studio. So glad that you're with us.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): My pleasure, Michele.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: First, Karim, tell us about this branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force. Who are they and what are their responsibilities?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): The Quds Force - Quds in Persian or in Arabic means Jerusalem. And it's a very elite branch of the Revolutionary Guards. We don't know exactly how many they are in number, but I think we're talking about hundreds, not thousands. Revolutionary Guards altogether are about 150,000 troops. And they're a very elite branch, I think they have military activities that would compare to something like the Navy Seals, very elitely trained.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): On the other hand, they're also conducting intelligence operations that maybe are akin to more along the lines of the CIA, or the FBI. And the Quds Forces in Iraq are not just operating in terms of the military power and flexing their muscles in that sense, but they're also operating a lot under the scenes, behind the scenes in terms of intelligence, buying support in Iraq, conducting kind of social capital experiments, funding mosques, funding clinics, things like that. So they're very much a versatile force in Iraq.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: Almost sounds like - you mentioned the Navy Seals. Almost sounds a bit like the CIA if you were trying to think of an American equivalent.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, they're a combination of a lot of these things, because they - I think they are trained militarily, but at the same time they're trained to conduct these intelligence operations as well. So I think something akin to an elite fighting force which also has this intelligence sound to it as well.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: There is also the question of control. We heard the president today say it's not clear exactly who picked up the phone and told them to do what they did. And some U.S. intelligence officials say that the Quds Force would not be doing this kind of thing unless they had approval from top leaders in Tehran. Does that make sense to you?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): What's an extent that does make sense? I mean if we look at the Iranian Constitution similar to the U.S. Constitution, the president of the United States is commander in chief of the U.S. military. Similarly in Iran, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has constitutional jurisdiction over the Revolutionary Guards. And the Quds Forces are a branch of the Revolutionary Guards, so hierarchically if you look at it, the Quds Forces ultimately do not report to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): But also, we have to be clear that this is a very dysfunctional regime in Tehran. You have many different types of personalities, many different types of institutions. It's not a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's Iraq was, where you have one person who's ruling by decree. Iran - the way decisions are made in Iran is very much a consensus building process, so there's an element of dysfunctionality that different institutions of the regime are conducting.
MICHELE NORRIS, host: If Iran does want to exercise broad influence throughout the region, where else is the Quds Forces are operating right now?
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): Well, in Lebanon, as well. There's been a lot of accusations in the past that Quds Forces has trained Hezbollah. This was an accusation that the Israelis made during the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006. And there's also, you know, concern that Iran has these Quds Forces and Revolutionary Guards well placed in some of the Shiite communities throughout the Persian Gulf. So for example, Saudi Arabia is a very, you know, key country, and the bulk of Saudi Arabia's energy reserves are in the eastern province.
Mr. KARIM SADJADPOUR (International Crisis Group): And the eastern province happens to have a Shiite majority population. And there is a concern, for example, that if Saudi Arabia somehow complicit in taking on Iran, if Saudi Arabia joins the United States in confronting Iran's nuclear posture, that Iran have capability to really make life difficult in Saudi's eastern province through these Quds Forces collaborating with local Shiite Saudi population.

Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?
Speaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.

But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.","The city of Alameda held a public meeting to discuss climate change and the carp population.

Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair.

Speaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th. Thank you.

But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.","The 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair was celebrated with a proclamation by Mayor Marilyn Ashcroft. The event, co-produced by the Downtown Alameda Business Association and Strum Productions, raises funds for the city's clean, green, and safe initiatives. The fair features live music, family-friendly entertainment, and locally crafted food and beverages. A free poster collection exhibit will be held at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery to celebrate the event's 35-year history. Three speakers addressed the council regarding matters not on the agenda, and one suggested that future draft plans be made more accessible to the public.",0,val,TofuEval

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair. So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair.

But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary. And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.","Summary: Strategies for managing carp include reducing their food sources, increasing predator populations, and using chemical and mechanical methods. The document also discusses the potential impacts of carp on the ecosystem and the need for continued research and monitoring.",0,test,TofuEval

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair. So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984. And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food. And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show. And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019. So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?
Speaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event. Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association. We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on.

If you go to the website, fly quiet. Okay. Okay. Dot com and scroll down. You'll see an app that you can load and then it's much easier to report the noise.

Nathaniel Basco had come up with his Eagle Scout project, which is a piano for the community to share. It'll be available for three weeks at our side of Nob Hill. Then after that, I think it's going to be moved to a permanent location. And I want to also recognize Deirdre Freeman, the local artist who painted it for the project.

Speaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.
Speaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.
Speaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?
Speaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.
Speaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.
Speaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.
Speaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.
Speaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.
Speaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money. This is not impacting our general fund, and I think we're serving our community well.

Speaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.
Speaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.
Speaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.
Speaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.
Speaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.
Speaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money.

He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits.

Speaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.
Speaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.
Speaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?
Speaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.
Speaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.
Speaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.
Speaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.

Speaker 0: Do we have any engineers as part of our staff? Can you describe the types of engineers that we have as part of our staff?
Speaker 2: So the building official is has a degree in architecture, which is structural engineers and architects are the ones who can do the plan, check services. And then we have our supervising building inspector is a plan examiner, a certified plans examiner. So those are the two certified staff that we have.
Speaker 0: But do we have any engineers as part of our staff? That's actually my concern.
Speaker 2: We currently do not have a structural engineer, Madame Mayor. We have engineers in our public works department.
Speaker 0: Advanced planning. No, no, no. So that's that's where I'm that's where my question goes. My preference would be that we have at least one engineer on our staff. And it appears that that's counter to what the plan currently is with staff, that you plan to continue to have a consulting firm as opposed to an engineer that's actually an employee of the city, which I we used to have that and I and I think I've seen that that issue has been raised in regards to having an engineer as part of our planning department. So that was my concern. And I pulled out. And I actually think that the community is interested in this issue because there have been multiple letters to the editor regarding engineers as part of our planning department, separate from public works. And I appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Right. Most of those letters, though, are all about the public works engineers. Those letters that we've received have not been about the planning department. But I understand what you're saying, and we can take a look at it, because our building official, who has a degree in architecture, is able to do the same types of plan checking as a structural engineer it we just feel like it's more efficient to be able to access multiple structural engineers during our very busy period. And that's really what what we need and what we need. Internal to our staff are the certified plans examiners. And that's we also we do have several certified plans examiners on staff.
Speaker 0: And I appreciate that. Thank you for the comments.
Speaker 8: No, I just said I'm willing to move approval because I think Mr. Potter gave an excellent explanation if we want to keep these projects moving. Time is money. This is not impacting our general fund, and I think we're serving our community well. So with that, I will move approval of item five after recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for a 12 month term in an amount not to exceed $300,000.
Speaker 0: We have a second.
Speaker 3: Second. All right.
Speaker 0: Any other comments? All those in favor.
Speaker 3: I think you.
Speaker 0: Of motion passes 4 to 1. Thank you. Thank you. And now we have speakers on five. Q And five are with you.
Speaker 1: And five Q is a final passage of ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code by adding article? What does that 14 to Chapter six concerning review of rent increases.",The proposed ordinance amends the Alameda Municipal Code by adding a new article to Chapter 6 concerning the review process for rent increases. The amendment requires landlords to provide tenants with a 90-day notice prior to increasing rent and allows the city to impose a rent control ordinance. The amendment also establishes a review process for rent increases and provides for penalties for non-compliance.,0,val,TofuEval
AlamedaCC_09012015_2015-1940_113_Review Process for Rent Increases_model_E,"Speaker 1: Five F recommendation to authorize the Interim City Manager to execute an agreement with CSG consulting services for professional plant services for 12 months. Permanent amount not to exceed 300,000.
Speaker 0: And I pulled this item. I don't know if staff wants to present anything about it. I pulled it because it's for up to 300,000 for structural engineer or an engineering firm. And it's my understanding that we, the city had had had an engineer through that, resigned in June. And so now we're being asked to approve a contract with a consulting firm out of San Mateo to make up for that. That would be up to 12 months and $300,000.
Speaker 2: So. Good evening. My name is Debbie Potter and I'm the city's community development director. And it is accurate that we had a plan check engineer that was working with the city. He actually resigned a year ago in June. So we have been using outside planned check services for several years now. We are using these planned check services. We are incredibly busy at the permit center and the flexibility that we have by using planned check services outside, planned check services we can use from one to 10 to 15 plan checkers all at the same time to keep moving our projects through the system. And while we do use planned check services, it should be noted that about 75% of all plan checking happens over the counter right here at City Hall. But 25% of our projects are complicated enough that they have to go out to a structural engineer. We're using CSG. It's the same plan check services that we that the fire department uses for its planned tech services. So that synergy has been very nice for us to have plan checkers that are very familiar with both the city's fire code and then all the building codes. We would like to continue on with the services that we are receiving from CSG. There is no impact on the general fund CSG. The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits. It's no impact on the general fund and we will be continuing to look throughout this fiscal year at how we want to staff up that function within the department. And we're looking at perhaps keeping outside contract services and then possibly under filling the position with a plans examiner so we can do more over the counter. So we feel like we have an efficient model in place and it's really based on that analysis and the track record for the last year and a half that we're recommending approval of this contract for the current fiscal year.

Speaker 3: Straws.
Speaker 5: Yes, Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. I pulled this item because I think it is worthy of our hearing here in the public. This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor. I wanted to let staff report exactly on what this Global Green Initiative is actually all about. And so I turn it over to the city manager.
Speaker 8: Mayor. Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.
Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well.

This is a endeavor that is very important to North Lawn Beach communities, particularly those neighborhoods surrounding the Market Avenue corridor. I wanted to let staff report exactly on what this Global Green Initiative is actually all about. And so I turn it over to the city manager.
Speaker 8: Mayor. Councilmember Andrews This is a project that's very near and dear to Councilmember Austin's heart. And I'm going to turn it over to our sustainability manager, Larry Rich, to tell us what's happening. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the Council. One of the things that we do in the Office of Sustainability is always looking for grant opportunities to pursue either for funding or, in this case, technical assistance. And so and this particular grant opportunity, the organization Global Green reached out to us and invited us to apply for a program that they're doing that's called the Sustainable Neighborhood Assessment. This is the third year of their program. In the past two years, they've selected in each of the years, seven or eight other cities around the country. This year they were looking for another seven or eight cities. And so Long Beach applied. We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.
Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well. And so Market Street is a is a is a priority for this. My office and you can count on my full participation in my office is full participation in this assessment process can make it successful.

We in working with the Development Services Department and looking into previous planning efforts, we selected a neighborhood in in the eighth District in the vicinity of Market Street and the Virginia Village right there at Market and Language Boulevard. And so what this is all about is we previously interacted with Global Green to create our green building policy for both municipal development and private development. And in that policy, we use a tool called the Lead Checklist LEED being leadership in energy and environmental design. So at this point in the city of Long Beach, we've got more than 30 LEED certified buildings, some of which are city owned facilities such as Fire Station 12 or the gas and oil building that was recently completed. There's a there's a different product that we're not as familiar with that's called LEED for Neighborhood Development. So over the course of this grant technical assistance, we will be doing a assessment of this neighborhood around Market Street with a mind to what sort of strengths the neighborhood has, what sort of green opportunities exist. And we will be provided with a report and assessment at the end of the process that will make recommendations to the city about how it might proceed with development projects in that neighborhood to introduce green elements such as pedestrian friendliness, stormwater improvements, open space linkages and so on. The technical assistance involves an intensive three day site visit by the Global Green Experts, where we'll do. A city team will be assembled to work with the Global Green team. We'll do a walk the neighborhood to get a feel for what's going on, on the ground, review the existing plans that have been completed for the area, run through the the lead for neighborhood development checklist to review opportunities there, hold a couple or a stakeholder meeting and also a an evening community input meeting and then tie all that information together in what I've seen done for the other cities that have completed this process, a 20 to 25 page report that then comes back to the city and it'll be on us to implement recommendations that are made in that report. So that's a kind of a quick overview of what we're talking about for this neighborhood. We're excited in the Office of Sustainability because, as I said, we don't necessarily have experience with the lead for neighborhood development tool. So it'll be a good learning experience for city staff and hopefully we'll pick up some things through this process that will be applicable to neighborhoods across the city. That's the end of my report and I'm ready for any questions.
Speaker 5: Well, I'll just give you a comment and say, you know, I'm looking forward to this. I know many of our residents are looking forward to it. And as you say, stakeholders as well in the area. I think this project will this assessment will help tie in Virginia Village. Which has already seen significant city investment. On that with the Forest Wetlands Project is coming to Earth as well.

Speaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.
Speaker 1: This is a quick one.
Speaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.
Speaker 1: The.
Speaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.
Speaker 1: Will give.
Speaker 9: The police.
Speaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.
Speaker 1: Bike theft problem head.
Speaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.
Speaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.

They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.

Speaker 6: I'm not. Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.
Speaker 1: Speak about this?
Speaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.
Speaker 1: This is a quick one.
Speaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.
Speaker 1: The.
Speaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.
Speaker 1: Will give.
Speaker 9: The police.
Speaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.
Speaker 1: Bike theft problem head.
Speaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.
Speaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie. Thank you.

But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes. So I'm excited about seeing this progress in program, you know, coming to action. Thank you, Councilman Price.

But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes. So I'm excited about seeing this progress in program, you know, coming to action. Thank you, Councilman Price.

Speaker 0: Item two, I was communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Spano, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Turanga. Recommendation to require a city manager to develop a free voluntary bike registration program by partnering with Project 5 to 9.
Speaker 4: Thank you. I can have everyone just say we're going to keep moving the agenda as we exit. So please. Councilwoman Price.
Speaker 6: I'm not. Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.
Speaker 1: Speak about this?
Speaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.
Speaker 1: This is a quick one.
Speaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents. Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed. Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.
Speaker 1: The.
Speaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners. And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.
Speaker 1: Will give.
Speaker 9: The police.
Speaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.
Speaker 1: Bike theft problem head.
Speaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents. And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.

After listening to the city fashioning and having the city attorney examine it together with the clerk. Declare a state of emergency. Postpone. The election for one year, during which time the city will hire a retired US federal judge. Obviously not from the ninth Circuit. To help bring this, we put the city back on a sound footing. And a year from now. Go back to the public. And that's based upon the fact that every day I hear from more and more people and. Both sides of the aisle. The overwhelming sentiment is the two choices we have in terms of the mayoral election, and that's all I'm talking about, the mayoral election. The two choices are simply putrid, period.

Remember, the guys came to they came to this country with $0 and were really poverty. They were living on food stamps. The mother had severe cancer and so forth. Fast forward to today that they signed it. Zuckerberg had the guy over to his house for lunch and they had been working on the deal for a few months into that, running up for that. They decided to sign the deal and they picked up the phone and they called their respective legal teams and said, meet us over here, will sign the paperwork. And the guy said, Listen, I've got a better place to sign that. And Zuckerberg said, Fine, here we go. They hopped in the car, went about 20, 20 minutes, 20 miles away, and it was a vacant building. And that was the only obstacle.

Speaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.

That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop.

Speaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.

We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you.

That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop. I think they've come to realize now that the potential dollars that we're talking about here are approaches, approaches that which has resulted in the increase in the incarceration of the people in Bell.

Speaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead.

That is going to hold up, I believe, the use of tidelands funds. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Vice Chair Councilors if I can, to point out as a city manager, we have no idea what.
Speaker 2: Mr. Good he is talking about. Any of the allegations just made are just made up. We have no idea. We never heard about this. So I just want to make that very, very clear that we have no idea what he's talking about.

Speaker 6: Good evening, Council and vice mayor. I appreciate you letting me speak today. Maureen Poe from 144 7:00 Naples. Since 1939, the present Naples sea walls have been standing and they've stood the test of time. But more than 18 years ago, the city had prudently paid attention to the cries from homeowners in the Naples Improvement Association, and they had done several studies. One of them was the Cash and Associates, and one of them was the Moffatt and Nickel Report. And when I was president of the Nhia, they came to a meeting and they told people that we have walls that are deteriorating and we have to do something about them quickly. And they had an estimate that it would cost about 78 million to do the entire island. And with neighborhood volunteers, we came together and formed a seawall committee and about 20 people have consistently, once a month for 18 years every month, come together to provide input and to work with the city. And public works has been very receptive and responsive to our requests. And talking about these public seawalls, the city council is always provided us with continual funding during that time period to work on road repair. And there was a study done by the State Lands Commission and the city. There was a study prepared by transit systems and that particular one, the gentleman who was doing it, could even pull the wall pieces out by hand. So it was at that point it was in imminent danger of failure. And so six phases of a project were established at that time and moved ahead. Tetra Tech developed the phases in pieces and then the Coastal Commission looked at it. And through the help of Councilman DeLong and through continued help of our vice mayor here, he worked on the committee on the commission, the Coastal Commission, and helped to formulate the ways that we could get a project through that would be on the water side, because we were looking at the birds that nested the created creatures in the water. We looked at the public access and make sure that public access was being addressed. And so the plan that has been finally come up and it's taken more than eight years to pull it together, is now before you. And we know that we don't want to spend any more money on studies, and we know that this is a good use of the Thailande fund for public access to our waterways and the Coastal Commission blessed it. And we'd like you to bless it tonight.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Maureen, for all your work and the other public comments. Sea none believe there's a motion on the floor for item 12. Please go and cast your votes.
Speaker 0: Motion carries them both. Yes. Item 13 Its recommendation to adopt plans and specifications that authorize the city manager to contract with Hrb Inc. for pipeline replacement.","The document discusses item 13, which is a recommendation to adopt plans and specifications for pipeline replacement and authorize the city manager to contract with Hrb Inc. for the project.",1,val,TofuEval

Speaker 1: So moved a motion and a second. Any public comment on the item? Mr. Goodhue.
Speaker 4: An up.
Speaker 9: Very good. You click as the address. I support the concept in chief and I've studied the plan for doing it and moving forward in this first phase.
Speaker 0: And I think it makes it eminent sense.
Speaker 9: And I think also the mitigation plan for this first section makes sense. I'm not sure about the mitigation for the balance of the program, but at least for this sense that makes and for this first phase, it makes sense where the problem comes up. Excuse me.
Speaker 4: 1/2 and. Where the problem.
Speaker 9: Surfaces is in the the funding of it. And I support using tidelands funds. But I think the city is going to find itself in a position of not being able to use those tidelands funds pending the given the specter of the pending indictment and arrest the Vice mayor. Commissioner. Coastal Commissioner Garcia. There are some details handed out here relative to that, and next week I'll go further into it. But I think the city needs to examine methods of financing at it other than the Tidelands Agency, because I think the requisite authorities that have the ability to do so are going to put the foot on the neck until they clean up the corruption that is set forth in not only here, but this comes on the heels, of course, as you know, the chief counsel for the Department of Boating Waterways caught the city trying to illegally use money to benefit friends of Bob Foster in the Long Beach Yacht Club. That does not instill confidence. So I think it's foolish to move forward counting on the Tidelands funds until they get a master in here to clean up the shop. I think they've come to realize now that the potential dollars that we're talking about here are approaches, approaches that which has resulted in the increase in the incarceration of the people in Bell. The instant issue here that brings it into focus is to S and the Marine stadium that was put forward that saying it was an epicenter of crime.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.
Speaker 2: Yes. Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one. So I would strongly suggest let's just so strongly support the city council opposing measure. I mean, Proposition six.
Speaker 0: Becky, there's a motion and a second seconded by Councilman Austin. Councilman Austin.
Speaker 8: Yes. I'd also like to just weigh in and say, I think it's important for us to to stand by what we've worked for as a council and support it for for several years. It was the Fix Our Roads kind of campaign through the League of California Cities, a lot of our legislative advocacy for infrastructure support and dollars for state highways, but also for local roads as well, that this these dollars actually will go a long way, if I'm not mistaken. Stephanie, can you tell me specifically how much if SB six does pass, how much we would stand to lose as a city?
Speaker 2: Diana Chang.
Speaker 1: Good morning, Mayor.
Speaker 5: And Members of the City Council. SB 145 19 We've budgeted $8 million for.
Speaker 1: Projects in all nine council districts, and so those revenues would would likely.
Speaker 7: Be.
Speaker 5: Repealed and, and the projects would be without.
Speaker 1: A source of dedicated funding.
Speaker 8: So that's that's $8 million annually, correct?
Speaker 1: It's $8 million for FY 19.
Speaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.
Speaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.
Speaker 3: Streets and.
Speaker 1: Roads.
Speaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.
Speaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.
Speaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.
Speaker 0: Six and let me add one thing that wasn't, I think unless I missed it in Dana Takes presentation, which is that the SB one not just not only includes all the street work and the annual funding that comes in, but they're also doing specific, larger streets. And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive.

City officials are opposed to the initiative, which would repeal a 2017 gas tax increase and require future gas and vehicle taxes to be approved by voters. The city has budgeted $8 million for road projects in FY 19, which would be lost if Proposition 6 passes. Officials note that the gas tax is a small price to pay for infrastructure investment and that the loss of funding would require making up the shortfall elsewhere.",1,test,TofuEval

Speaker 2: Yes. Given the importance that SB one has provided for not only the city limits, but for the state as a whole, I think it's very important that we oppose this proposition because it would have a devastating effect on all the projects that we currently have going in the city alone, which because of SB one, and when you look at what's going on with the replacement bridge at the replacement Desmond Bridge, it would be a bridge going to nowhere if we didn't have the funds to finish that project. And we have as well some other projects in Long Beach, including the Long Beach Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and a lot of other projects that we have because of SB one.

Speaker 7: And as the revenues continue to be implemented as part of SB one, we're expecting them to grow to.
Speaker 5: 11 million in about FY 20 and then indexed to inflation thereafter. I would also like to note that this essentially doubles what the city currently receives from the state for streets.
Speaker 3: Streets and.
Speaker 1: Roads.
Speaker 5: Currently with just hooda the traditional source of state funding for streets and roads. Our our budget, it's about 10 million annually. So with SB one, we add another eight for FY19.
Speaker 7: About 11 for FY 20, and then adjusted to inflation every year thereafter.
Speaker 8: So I think it's a the the, the gas tax that we have is a small price to pay for, for good infrastructure investing in our future. The impact would be obviously significant for our public works infrastructure budget. And if we didn't if we lost those dollars, we'd have to be made up elsewhere. We and that would be less dollars that we could actually put toward residential streets, which I think are so important to our residents. And so for those reasons, I support this this motion to support to support or oppose. SB I'm to be very clear to oppose SB six.

And part of SB one separate of what we're getting annually this year is the entire reconstruction of PCH from our entrance point in Orange County, all the way through the city to our exit point in in western Long Beach. And so that is a project that the state's doing that's in Long Beach that doesn't count towards our our amount. And so that that's a huge project that is obviously incredibly, incredibly expensive.

Speaker 0: Mr. West, who's who's doing this?
Speaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Staff report will be given by Linda Tatum.
Speaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process.

Speaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one.

This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing. That concludes the presentation. But I'm here as well as Lisa Falls, our Administrative Services Bureau manager, who assisted on this project. And we can respond to any questions you have.

Speaker 2: Good afternoon, Mayor, and members of the Council. This item is a public hearing to consider a resolution to modify the city's master fee schedule for development services by reducing selected entitlement fees and adopting new fees related to the mailing of public hearing notices. As you recall, on September 18th, 2018, the City Council adopted an ordinance that amended various sections of the zoning code related to conditional use permits, and it also. This action that the Council took at that time also updated the public notification requirements. Since then, our staff has evaluated the specific entitlement application fees, which currently include the cost for mailed public hearing notices. So of what we found from that analysis is that approximately $950 of the current application fees go toward the costs of producing and mailing these public notices. So adoption of this resolution would effectively unbundle the noticing fees from the application fee for most of the entitlement applications that we process. This resolution would also establish a tiered fee structure for mailing public notices going forward. The proposed fee reduction is $950 less than the current application fees and the new publication or the new public noticing fees range from $410 for the standard 300 foot noticing radius for Tier one. And this is explained in a little bit more detail in your staff report. But there's also a Tier two noticing four or 500 foot radius, and that is whenever a project is within 300 feet of a residential development and it goes up to Tier three, which is $950 for noticing whenever a project is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses either a reduction of parking, shared parking or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering, like in a tattoo parlor as an example. So I just want to make sure that you're aware that this particular action will address mail notices, but it does not change any of the other standard notices that staff provides, and these include posting the notices in City Hall. We also post individual development sites with those large noticing posters. We also notice post notice on the city's website. We also notify city council offices as well as neighborhood organizations for all of the required public noticing for discretionary approvals. So I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that. And we feel that the proposed resolution tonight balances the direction of the council to reduce the costs of the conditional use permit process. But we think that it also provides ample notification to the to the public for discretionary actions. So staff recommends that the city council adopt the proposed resolution to reduce the application fees and also to establish the new tiered fee schedule for public noticing. That concludes the presentation. But I'm here as well as Lisa Falls, our Administrative Services Bureau manager, who assisted on this project. And we can respond to any questions you have.
Speaker 0: Thank you. I got a motion in a second. Let me just do is there any public comment first seen a public comment? Councilor Pearce.
Speaker 6: I just want to say great job staff are really tackling how to reduce those costs in a creative way. Thank you for your hard work.

The fees range from $410 for the standard 300-foot noticing radius to $950 for a project that is 750 feet or greater from any application that addresses a reduction of parking, shared parking, or a project where there is a code requirement for some kind of distance buffering.",1,val,TofuEval

Mr. CODE. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.
Speaker 0: And.
Speaker 5: BURGESS, thank you very much. This ordinance, which passed unanimously out of committee, establishes the Seattle Renters Commission to represent the interests of renters who live in Seattle. About 54% of Seattle households are occupied by renters. The purpose of the commission is to advise the Mayor and City Council on Public Policy matters of importance to renters and especially all of our renter protection, landlord protection laws and others. But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on. The commission will be comprised of 15 members, six appointed by the mayor, six appointed by the city council, two appointed by the commission and the final member young adult appointed through the Get Engaged program, which is a city YMCA program. The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters. And so if this commission can help bridge that relationship, then that'll be a positive move for our city.

Before I begin, I do want to have a special thank you to Zack DeWolf for his leadership and boldness, not only for the residents of Capitol Hill and the community and all the all the projects that he works on, but also taking on a big project for all the residents of Seattle. Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Before I begin, I do want to have a special thank you to Zack DeWolf for his leadership and boldness, not only for the residents of Capitol Hill and the community and all the all the projects that he works on, but also taking on a big project for all the residents of Seattle. Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions.

Before I begin, I do want to have a special thank you to Zack DeWolf for his leadership and boldness, not only for the residents of Capitol Hill and the community and all the all the projects that he works on, but also taking on a big project for all the residents of Seattle. Again, as we say in Indian Country, my hands are up to you. Thank you. I just want to point out that the demographics of our city have changed a lot over the years. I think it's important to note. In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions. I was grateful to co-sponsor this legislation and I'm happy to vote in favor of today. Thank you.

Speaker 5: BURGESS, thank you very much. This ordinance, which passed unanimously out of committee, establishes the Seattle Renters Commission to represent the interests of renters who live in Seattle. About 54% of Seattle households are occupied by renters. The purpose of the commission is to advise the Mayor and City Council on Public Policy matters of importance to renters and especially all of our renter protection, landlord protection laws and others. But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on. The commission will be comprised of 15 members, six appointed by the mayor, six appointed by the city council, two appointed by the commission and the final member young adult appointed through the Get Engaged program, which is a city YMCA program. The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters. And so if this commission can help bridge that relationship, then that'll be a positive move for our city. So council members Herbold, O'Brien and Suarez have joined me in sponsoring this legislation and we urge its adoption.

In my district alone, we now have 49% renters and 51% homeowners. And I believe that those people should have a voice. It's important that renters are, recognize and are engaged in the city process and certainly in the decisions. City commissions are a way of establishing a clear commitment to engage with communities who have a stake in the work of the city. Similarly to the new Community Involvement Commission, I believe this new commission will broaden the city's ability to increase and deepen the contributions of citizens to our legislative decisions. I was grateful to co-sponsor this legislation and I'm happy to vote in favor of today. Thank you.

Speaker 2: The Report of the Affordable Housing Neighborhoods and Finance Committee and Item one Council 118 921 Relating to renters establishing the Seattle Renters Commission representing the interests of renters located in Seattle to advise and make recommendations to the Mayor and City Council and public policy matters of importance to renters citywide amending Section 3.35. 330 of the Seattle Ms. of Code and adding new Chapter 3.65 consisting of Section 3.60 5.0. 10.0, 15.0, 30.0 40.0 58.0 60 of Seattle. Mr. CODE. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.
Speaker 0: And.
Speaker 5: BURGESS, thank you very much. This ordinance, which passed unanimously out of committee, establishes the Seattle Renters Commission to represent the interests of renters who live in Seattle. About 54% of Seattle households are occupied by renters. The purpose of the commission is to advise the Mayor and City Council on Public Policy matters of importance to renters and especially all of our renter protection, landlord protection laws and others. But also beyond that to what renters care about citywide. And that is things like transit. Rotation, public health and safety parks and open space education and other topics that renters in our city engage on. The commission will be comprised of 15 members, six appointed by the mayor, six appointed by the city council, two appointed by the commission and the final member young adult appointed through the Get Engaged program, which is a city YMCA program. The Commission will be staffed through the Department of Neighborhoods and assuming this passes and the mayor signs it, which I believe he will, outreach about the commission and applications for individuals who would like to be appointed to the commission will begin in April. We hope that we can complete that in May or early June and the Commission can start meeting early this summer. There's been a lot of talk about the renter's commissioner and whether we need the renters commissioner or don't need the renters commission. Some have suggested that this is an anti landlord move. That's certainly not the case. We just want to give renters a formal voice here at City Hall. And as I said last week in discussing this, renters need landlords and landlords need renters. And so if this commission can help bridge that relationship, then that'll be a positive move for our city. So council members Herbold, O'Brien and Suarez have joined me in sponsoring this legislation and we urge its adoption.

So the first one is an agreement between the public service and industrial employees. Local 1239. That agreement will last till the end of December 2018. And I should probably should have said that I am filling in for Councilmember Burgess in his absence on this legislation. That particular agreement with one, two, three nine affects up to 125 regular sitting employees and up to 225 active temporary employees. The second counts, Bill 118646 is between the city and the Teamsters local union. 117 And I think all of you are familiar with 117 and the agreement affects up to 15 regular city employees and up to 200 active temporary employees. Again, that agreement will last through the end of 12th December 2018. In the last bill, 118644 is between the city and the Washington State Council of County and City Employees f. S CME Local 21. And that agreement again last to the end of December 2018, and that affects up to 150 regular city employees. And contrary to some of the public testimony that you heard today, we believe that these these agreements are acceptable to the employees, that their ability to to unionize and be a strong member of their respective unions strengthens our entire city and is for the benefit of our workers who mean the most to us. And so the certainly we recommend approval of these three agreements, which are all consistent with the parameters set by the Council's Labor Relations Committee. I move to pass in Lester.
